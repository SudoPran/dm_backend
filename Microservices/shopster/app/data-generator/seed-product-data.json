Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ‚Çπ99/- with the offers and so I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone‚Äôs battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ‚Çπ350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn‚Äôt tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn‚Äôt get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money",

This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever.

    "review": "Wonderful TV and Awful installation service from amazon,Acer Television Review,It's a good product for that price.,Good for the price,Almost a complete package,Nice Product,Good product,Super designed",
    "reviewContent": "About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It's awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can't use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It's running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it's good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money",

It is working excellent, I'm using for lapptop to big screen TV connectivity, and could see the undistorted picture and sound, nicely doing its work.A few words of cons..1.

    "review": "Worthy and most affordable - Great TV,Good product,It's really worth the money but,Better product in this budget,Product review,nice tv,Best product,Budget friendly TV",
    "reviewContent": "This OnePlus TV is great if you want a affordable and middle range features TV. I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don't have a aux cable so I'm not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won't work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won't connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it's a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it's been 4 months and it's super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that's all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I'm happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4. Voice recognition is good,LikeBudget-friendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poor.Many times gets disconnected.Color depth not that good.",

So far super,Good,Seems durable but there is a problem with the design that the pin is not long enough / base of the pin is too thick that i couldn't insert it into my phone's charging port without removing the case!,Over all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin ‚Çπ99 me 1.5m cable k hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai. Maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai. Agar ‚Çπ150 me mile to mt lena utne layak nhi hai.",

    "reviewContent": "It does the job really well. No complaints regarding the charging power. At a price of Rs. 199/-, it is worth every buck. Although this cable is a bit shorter than the original one, but the original OnePlus cable is around Rs.900/-. So there is a huge price difference, and it does the same job as the original one.,Useful for ‚Äúc‚Äù type charging. But not suitable with all adapters or USB points. Serves the purpose.,Sturdily built. Does its job well. Charged my Samsung Galaxy M51 quicker than the original cable. Hope it stays the same going ahead.,Liked the charging speed disliked the length. On iPads this is awesome but it‚Äôs is not 6 foot long so this the only point to think otherwise it is the best cable,Good,Everything is good including connectivity and stuff,Nice product..im using this for my car,This product is nice and worth the amount...I recommend it to anyone who are looking for this kind of cable",

    "review": "Decent product. Value for money.,Value for money,Improvements Needed,Everything thing good except the installation experience,Overall taking all aspects TV is good within the price point,Tv installation services,One among the good TVs in the market.,Picture",
    "reviewContent": "I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage: Continuous, OTT only, no Cable/Dish operator.Average daily usage: 6-8 hours.The TV is a great value-for-money product.Installation: The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.Picture: The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hi-res TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn't look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else's better TV.Sound: Sound output is decent. You wouldn't need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote: Sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. It's exactly like Amazon's remote.OS: Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldn't find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didn‚Äôt faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. It‚Äôs like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can‚Äôt eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, it‚Äôs good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) The installation guy didn‚Äôt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn‚Äôt came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2) The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didn‚Äôt got the replacement for the product and it‚Äôs totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4 ‚≠ê for picture quality, 3‚≠ê for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen",

Here's a quick Fact for the User's complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio, guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv, then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees & here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K. So just check once, what options you have before complaining.Eventually I bought this TV, since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom. Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks, I am stating my DETAILED user experience. Its a detailed & huge review, but do read it, if you want to invest this much amount.‚óè‚óè If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review ‚óè‚óè# Firstly its budget friendly & ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market.# Has Most number of Output port ( 1*AV, 3*HDMI, 2*USB ).# Has Android 8.1 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth# Has Dual interface - MI Patchwall & Android TV ( I mostly prefer android TV interface )# Remote has Bluetooth & Voice Search with sleek profile.# Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM + 8GB storage ( 4.7GB actual )# Speaker Output is low.# Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface.# Amazon prime & Netflix is NOT preloaded, but can be side loaded.# Native Display is ONLY HD, though 1080p & even 4K videos from youtube works well (check images attached).# Can install & play tons of High quality games like RR3, etc (check images attached).# Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time.FULL DETAILED REVIEW :---->BUILT QUALITY :------------------# Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body. Its not great, but above average.# Table top stands looks bit flimsy, but are workable.* The screws which are provided in the box, DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly, so I bought new from local store.# It has averagely slim profile, not the slimmest in the market.# Speaker Placement is inconvenient. Since they are placed at the bottom, so when you keep it on table top, the sound tends to dampen and bulge.# Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up.# Overall built quality is above average.DISPLAY QUALITY :---------------------# It has very Thin bezels, which looks great.# Video resolution is 1366x768p, but 1080p videos works fine on it.* 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well.# Viewing angle are good compared to price. ( Check the images attached )# Contrast is above average, Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid.# Display quality is also above average, not very great.REMOTE CONTROL :-----------------------# Its very sleek and compact.# Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate.# Fortunately it has Volume buttons, which is handy. ( I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote, so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume :P )# Placement of Voice search button is improper. Its just below Power button, and I end up pressing power button a lot.# Finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation.OTHER FEATURES :---------------------# It has Dual interface, i.e. Patchwall and android TV.  Has tons of content.# Many games can be installed (till you have memory left), including multiplayer games.# Google voice search is very useful, if you don't want to use keyboard.# Processing speed is fast and I haven't detected any lags yet. ( Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware )# Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly.CONS :------# Speaker output though rated 20W, is NOT upto the mark. My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound.# Placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens.# Internal Memory is very LESS.# NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them.# Miracast not supported. Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes.# Native resolution is just 720p HD, though the 1080p videos works on usb & 4K on youtube.# Screen is Slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other LED tv's.# Mixed experiences of after sales service.CUSTOMER CARE :--------------------# Firstly the installation is a Joke. My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is, there's ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product :P# Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative, so there's NO point of return window time frame.# MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services. Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet, I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful.VERDICT :-----------Considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average Display quality, want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the TV you should certainly go for. Trust me, you won't get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. If you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc.This is NOT a perfect smart TV, but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty, its NO brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.,This television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of ‚Çπ12500.Performance ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê-----------------------The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box. VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media support.Picture Quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------Many people complain about the overbright screen. But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings.These are my preferred settings.Backlight :1 to 20*********************During night even the lowest value of 1 is  bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes.During day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. A maximum of 20 would be enough.Setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during night.Brightness :48*****************Brightness setting controls black level.Increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast.Brightness at 50, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturationAt 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies.48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details.Contrast : 40 to 45*********************Contrast setting controls white level.Contrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45. Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. As the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast.Saturation: 45 to 50************************Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50. At 45 colors look more natural. At 50 colors looks a bit punchy. But still its a personal preference.At the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p . The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TV.LG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black DemoLG OLED Eclipse 2 DemoLG HD Demo Art NouveauFull HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV. Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named 'Life Untouched' and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium. Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good details.Screen Quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------I think this is a VA panel , the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels. The screen is glossy and hence reflective. This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing it.Like all other LCD panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but that's only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. While watching movies or other content it's not at all a problem. Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etc.Luckily there's no backlight bleeding in the unit  I received.Viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but that's a common VA panel characteristic. IPS panels with good viewing angles can't be expected at this price point.All LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. VA panels excels in black depth despite it's average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levels.Sound Quality ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê--------------------------Bass is a bit weak (I think bass is improved following some updates. So giving 5 stars from 4.) It's very loud even at low volume. Midrange and treble are very good. Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly.Edit:In a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good. But it isn't.100Hz : 7300Hz : 81000Hz : 43500 Hz : 610000 Hz : 5A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled.The following settings sounds much better and here's the reason.100 Hz : 8 - BassFrequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick Drum,Toms, Snare etc.300 Hz : 4 - Low MidrangeEnhances bass and depth of male vocals. Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds1000 Hz : 3 - MidrangeImparts a metallic tone. Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant.3500 Hz : 5 - Upper MidrangeVocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. A value of 5 enhances vocal quality. Increasing too much makes vocals harsh.10000 Hz : 7 -TrebleAdds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. Enhances tinkling  sounds of metallic  instruments.Human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here it's 1000 and 3500 Hz. Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. Even increasing 300Hz is disturbing.Great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. But considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves 4 stars.Remote Control ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê-----------------------------Minimalism is great. But minimalism with less functionality is not so great. Addition ofMute,TV Settings and Video input selection buttons would 've made the remote more functional.App support ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê(Update)-----------------------When the TV was released there was no support for Netflix and Amazon Prime. But now with Pie update it supports both Netflix and Amazon Prime. Now the TV deserves 5 stars for app support.Pros and Cons--------------------------- Pros:1. Powerful processor for 4K media playback.2. App installation via USB3. Built in Chromecast4. Bluetooth remote5. Voice CommandCons: (Update)Previously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby option.But in the latest update both these issues are solved.Now when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input sourceTo enable it, go to Settngs >Inputs > Enable 'Stay on the previous source' option.Screen off feature is also added in the new update. Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off option.The only disadvantage left on the TV was lack of Miracast. But on a latest update build PI.4316 miracast is included and now its perfect.To sum up:--------------------Overall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of it's average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point. Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across India.New brands like iFFalcon, Blaupunkt ,Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price. But when it comes to service centres, it's a dead end.I am very much satisfied with the purchase.,It's good product,Good,if you like a best tv on your budget I'll recommend you this stunning picture quality and DTS surround is osm but there was a few lagging problem and Miracast is not good üôÅ,Build quality good.sound and bass excellent.,Product is very good. Sound quality is crisp. Worth buying. I brought it 2 years back. Still working fine,Good quality",

    "reviewContent": "ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon‚Äôs own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.)

The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition.

    "review": "Works flawlessly on Ubuntu 22.04 (if installed correctly),Best for kali. Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 ‚Ä¶,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product",
    "reviewContent": "I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for \"morrownr/8821au-20210708\" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product \"TP-Link AC600\" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don‚Äôt support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.",

    "reviewContent": "ABOUT  AMAZONBASICS:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAmazon Basics was launched in 2009 & is Amazon‚Äôs own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.Here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.)

    "reviewContent": "I got this for 6k. At this price point, I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn't expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn't have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall, I'd say, for a small room, it's a 7/10.,Value for money, Satisfied with the product till now,This Led tv low budget Good üëç Performance but picture & audio not good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QvXYP2McL._SY88.jpg,Good,Tv is great but the installation guy asked me for 400‚Çπ paid installation... Misleading information but again for this price it's good tv. Don't pay installation guy you can do it yourself,,I will give it 4 stars out of 5. I bought this 32 inch VW at 6150 after discounts. Picture quality and sound quality is good.I added firestick to it and it voila became smart tv. The connections to attach these usbs are at the bottom part of the tv which is slightly different from other tvs.So far, working as it should.Revising this after 9 days, the tv is not responding to switch off button. This is happening more when i watch the tv for a few hours and then when i switch off the tv with the firestick remote, the yellow colour indicator down below does not turn red, instead it remains yellow. As far as screen is concerned, the tv's screen changes to black whitish, seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode. This is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red. i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees, then i should get a replacement as i got still 2 days time to replace it.Just a helping note for people buying this tv: if you are going to connect firestick to it, as it asks for the brand name of the tv, you can select VU and it will perfectly work on your firestick. Thanks and enjoy!",

    "reviewContent": "I use this to connect an old PC to internet. I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you'll have range problems if you're not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires. Signal strength is good.... just wonder what would be different in other adapters of lesser known brands which are available at a much more competitive pricing, hence a star less.,Pros:*Easy to use & Portable*Can be connected to Mobile Hotspot and used in PC( Budget Friendly)*Less installation process*No heating issues & Good Coverage*Best alternative for USB Tethering (phone's battery may get damaged for long term run with Tethering)Cons:*Internet connection speed varies at times, also depends on your modem or cellular connection*Issues occur while installing via CD, which is available along with the product( Installation driver can be downloaded from TP-Link site)*Needed to reconnect the adapter every time system is turned ON*Will not work if your software has some issues, so encountered any just update your system(worked for me)*Support Center is worse, calls are unattended most of the times or just visit nearby storeConclusion:Brought this @499/-Ideal for users who don't need very high speed internet usage,a good alternative for USB Tethering and are on Budge(1080p Youtube videos can be easily played with this without any interruptions),wifi connectivity is a great good result for me. however, some jitter problems did exist.,This is perfect device to connect wifi. Go for it.,This wifi adopter is good working,(Pictures attached)Size/Design:  ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖBuild Quality: ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖPackaging:  ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖSoftware:  ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖSpeed:  ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖConnectivity:  ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖExperience:  ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖWarranty:  ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖSize and Design:The best part about this is that it is very compact in size and very sober and elegant in design. This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever. Works nicely seemless connectivity",

    "review": "Worthy and most affordable - Great TV,Good product,It's really worth the money but,Better product in this budget,Product review,nice tv,Best product,Budget friendly TV",
    "reviewContent": "This OnePlus TV is great if you want a affordable and middle range features TV. I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don't have a aux cable so I'm not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won't work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won't connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it's a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it's been 4 months and it's super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that's all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I'm happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4. Voice recognition is good,LikeBudget-friendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poor.Many times gets disconnected.Color depth not that good.",

    "review": "Best(Branded) Budget TV,A high-quality 4k Smart TV from Samsung,Received Defective,Got Replacement,Nice product but,Tv is good,Best budget tv,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product",
    "reviewContent": "Before finalizing the AUE60 55\", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55\" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I'll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV's speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a VA panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I'd say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung's SmartThings App, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV's design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I'd say I'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. It's a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I'd highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. I don't require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. It also lacks base.Purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,But the picture quality is ok-ok.,Best tv product in given price range,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product",

But I needed a 1.5m length for perfect use. So disappointed as I have to rotate the cooling pad and use it (cable falls short by around 15cm).,It works well. The cable is soft and flexible.

    "reviewContent": "Worth the price. I use the local cable providers set up. With my previous tv (Samsung) I was not facing this problem.  The only problem I am facing is each time I turn off the tv from the mains, I have to go to the settings and turn the settings on to tv speaker settings despite no other speaker or WiFi or blue tooth or cell phone being in the proximity. As a result I have stopped turning the tv off from the mains. I just use remote control to put it on stand by. BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN,,Display is very good. Sound is average iam using soundbar so no issues for me. Don't know how long it will last due to my previous mi 55 4 pro panel gone in 2.5 years.

Nice Product & Highly Recommended.,Good quality and looks beautiful... I will surely recommend,( After using it for 3 weeks). I use Samsung M51, few months back my USB Cable was torn, so I wasn't able to fast charge. It took a decade to charge from 20-90%. Samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy, so I was searching for something durable. While browsing through the product page I was skeptical to place an order, as the company claimed too many features in such a low price. Keeping the negative thoughts aside I ordered it anyhow. The product was delivered well in advance, which made me happy.I unboxed and plugged in the cable, to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed. The ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear, it has LED indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone. Also, the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity.It easily fast charges my phone in an hour. Overall, I'm very happy with the product.I highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a fast charging Type C to C cable.Will update this review if any change is observed.",

    "reviewContent": "Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand's inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. üëçüèª,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it's super product and 3 year's of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one.

    "review": "Good product,Its good, but micro usb doesn't fit my phone.,Good and useful item,It is very best cable,good,2 in 1 Charging Cable.,Sturdy cable overall,Nice & Best Charger Cabel",
    "reviewContent": "Product is good , and also it's  strudiness .But no fast charging in this cable , it's normally charging . I love it because it's supported in micro usb , or type c . Over all good .Pros / advantage :- -1) 1.5 meter wire  2) more durable3) supported dual mode type c , micro usbCons / disadvantages:- normal charging , not fast charging,Though it is braided, but it is not strong like boAt. But it's okay to use it. Supports turbocharging.,Working well after months of use. Only thing is that if there is slight pressure, the C -type adapter will come off from the micro usb head. So better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the C type adapter. Otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with C type charging and a small Tab with micro USB charging when i travel. I need to carry only one cable now with my powerbank. Will recommend.,Best cable,good,Both Micro USB & Type C mobile connector's are getting charge.Good Decision to purchase this product.,Cable is a good fibre braided with good length.The connector also has a tight fit, sometimes you have to apply a bit force to remove(ig it'll wear off after usage).In comparison, boat has a better quality i would say if u get that in offer as it has metal braided cable and better quality microusb pin.,I like the product bcuz it's help me to charge both phone Type C & Micro Cabel",

    "review": "Decent product. Value for money.,Value for money,Improvements Needed,Everything thing good except the installation experience,Overall taking all aspects TV is good within the price point,Tv installation services,One among the good TVs in the market.,Picture",
    "reviewContent": "I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage: Continuous, OTT only, no Cable/Dish operator.Average daily usage: 6-8 hours.The TV is a great value-for-money product.Installation: The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.Picture: The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hi-res TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn't look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else's better TV.Sound: Sound output is decent. You wouldn't need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote: Sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. It's exactly like Amazon's remote.OS: Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldn't find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didn‚Äôt faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. It‚Äôs like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can‚Äôt eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, it‚Äôs good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) The installation guy didn‚Äôt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn‚Äôt came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2) The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didn‚Äôt got the replacement for the product and it‚Äôs totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations. Not able to find the real Dolby stereo effect. Remote not upto the mark.4 ‚≠ê for picture quality, 3‚≠ê for both sound and remote quality,Good quality picture but it hangs on home screen",

    "review": "Wonderful TV and Awful installation service from amazon,Acer Television Review,It's a good product for that price.,Good for the price,Almost a complete package,Nice Product,Good product,Super designed",
    "reviewContent": "About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It's awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can't use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It's running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it's good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money",

    "review": "Best(Branded) Budget TV,A high-quality 4k Smart TV from Samsung,Received Defective,Got Replacement,Nice product but,Tv is good,Best budget tv,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product",
    "reviewContent": "Before finalizing the AUE60 55\", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55\" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I'll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV's speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a VA panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I'd say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung's SmartThings App, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV's design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I'd say I'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. It's a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I'd highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. I don't require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. It also lacks base.Purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,But the picture quality is ok-ok.,Best tv product in given price range,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product",

    "reviewContent": "This OnePlus TV is great if you want a affordable and middle range features TV. I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don't have a aux cable so I'm not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won't work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won't connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it's a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it's been 4 months and it's super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that's all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I'm happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4. Voice recognition is good,LikeBudget-friendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poor.Many times gets disconnected.Color depth not that good.",

    "reviewContent": "TV looks fine, however I see some lag while selecting the applications such as Amazon prime etc. I didn‚Äôt install any new apps.,Received the TV on time.Good Things about TV and TCL:-1. Quick Response:- After the TV is delivered call the customer care for the installation and within 2 hour technician arrive and installed the TV. After that received call back from the customer care to gather the experience and pinged on whatsapp so that if in future encountered any issue quick help will be provided.2. Quality:- Quality of TV is good and can watch all the contents from the apps in max resolution supported by TV i.e., 1080p.3. Steal deal, during the GIF sale received the TV in 13299 which is just wow price.4. Sound Quality is good.5. Android 11 is good and the extra feature which I find beneficial when compared to my old android 9 tv is the voice search feature which now search the content from another apps also after giving permission which is not working on android 9 tv.6. Bluetooth remote with some extra feature. Bought the TV as already have the TCL s6500 32 inch model back in 2018 when it is launched and tv is working flawlessly and since did not encountered any issue so bought this brand tv again when required second TV.Improvement :-1. Bluetooth remote should have the all apps button on remote instead of TCL menu which my previous android s6500 tv have, due to which have to move with some extra click which is annoying for my parents to use.2. in Bluetooth remote they provide some extra button to move directly to youtube, netflix, tcl channel, prime, guard and media, instead of this some customization be provided so that we can configure the buttons to some others apps as per our personal use. out of these button guard, media and tcl channel are most useless button.3. android tv should come with atleast 1.5gb as with 1 GB variant the tv is little slow and already have many preinstalled tcl apps which we cannot remove so tv experience in little bit slow, however buy the model by knowing this limitation as already using 1.5 GB ram old variant of the same brand.other feature are also these which are cons but those are already mentioned in description and user should be aware of them before buying like one such point is 3.1 star is removed because of point 1 and point 3 as it is not making fluid experience of using android tv when watch all the contents from the apps.,Good for value almost all apps r able to download,Less weight and pretty valuable to the budget... And even customer support also available all time.,Like,Good one for this price. .

    "reviewContent": "Good looking amd working fine.,I brought this primarily because my Lenovo Laptop (Windows 11) has only one USB 3 port, no ethernet slot and one c-connector port.While in office immediately after purchase of this TP-Link UE330 3-Port USB Hub and Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, I used this for the ethernet connectivity to my office network.  Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external hard-disk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs (two numbers) and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. It‚Äôs compatible with all. It‚Äôs plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when I‚Äôm working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when it‚Äôs not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product would‚Äôve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didn‚Äôt make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps. Thanks.",

    "reviewContent": ",Screen quality is good.It's been a month I bought it still working fine.Two main negatives are1‚Ä¢ It doesn't have default option to directly start on tata sky tv, we have to select hdmi option from input menu to select tata sky which one is plugged in.2‚Ä¢ dosent allow us to command/choose volume up or down from set-top box remote (mine tata sky)We have use tv remove to change the volume setting.Other than that great tv, mine ps4 works fine with it great graphics.Conclusion: If someone ask's me to if they Can buy it or notMine answer will be nor yes nor no.If we you want kinda cheap but decent  quality tv and taking the risk on unknown tv brand on their reliability( just like me ) then go for it.Better then Samsung or Sony ??? Definitely no!!.,I always buy and recommend Samsung Sony or LG for TV. But, I had a hard budget this time and chose Vu because my friends have been using it for at least 4-5 years without much issues.While the delivery and installation were excellent, and TV on the whole is a decent package which gives good clarity than the rival Chinese TVs and Sound, smart features are poor here.You can connect Bluetooth headphones but no option to disconnect them. I had to pair and unpair everytime.There is no voice command button on remote. Even while using the screen button for voice input, nothing gets recognised. My 3k Fire stick voice recognition was tooo good.,I purchased VU gloled 55 inches TV after suggestion from my techie friends and online study. Technician from amazon came to my home for installation in drunken mode. But I compromised with him due to busy schedule of work. He installed tv with his small screws instead of VU standard wall screws. He did whatever he want. Proper installation was not performed.I just calm down then later i gave a complaint to amazon and VU Customer services. Amazon was not properly responded till now. But from VU side i got a huge response of problem solving. Min 3 to 4 customercare executives spoke with me, finally VU's vice President mr prashanth phoned me and apologized me for inconvenience happened to me. He told drunken technician is not from VU. I feel good for VU's Top level executives have interaction with me. From bottom to top level VUs Team in touch with me for a month to resolve my issue due to i stayed away from home. Before few days back technician came to my home again from vu. He reinstalled my tv in perfect position with dedication. I never expect this much customer friendly behaviour from VU Thank you very much VU. Kudos to VU Team...",

Writing this review after using the tv for more than a week.1. picture quality is good.2. Sound could be better. Dosnt' mean its bad.3. connectivity is good.4. No issues with software or hardware till now.Overall a good product in this budget. Once again thanks Amazon and LG.,This is good smart tv,I wanted to get display for my PS4.  I was contemplating between a monitor and TV.  Since,  there is no need to get display with high resolution, I opted for this TV.  I have been using this TV for 3 months now.  Below are my observations when using this TV as a secondary TV or gaming TV.Pros:1.  This TV comes with the software from the bigger OLED TV of LG meaning,  to some extent better upscaling.2.  Since I am using primarily as a gaming TV, I love the Game mode.  You can truly see the difference when you play with and without Game mode.  Pic and responses are shaper and faster with Game mode active.3.  You can connect Bluetooth headset to TV.  Great when watching movies as a secondary option.4.  LG service is the best!!!  The come probably the next day,  install the TV (wall mount) for free - Really quick and clean.Cons:1.  No headphone Jack on the TV2.  You can connect a Bluetooth headphones to the TV.  However, for gamers,  the game mode is disabled when TV sound output is through headphones.  However, there is a work around for this.,,It is a good product from LG in range of 15k.Pros:1. Bluetooth support for my wireless earphone2. Audio output is enough for room size of 12√ó12.3. Wall mount installation is free of cost from LG.4. Smart remote in this range is really appreciable from LG. Doubt samsung provide smart remote this in this range.5. Picture quality is decent.,,,I love LG product and happy to buy this product with 15.5K. It's very good smart TV  with amazing features consist of Good processor, Smart Remote,  Good LCD screen and sound quality is also good.Recommended to purchase.",

    "reviewContent": "Yeap this cable support 65w fast charging tested on my 65w brick of realme 7 pro..Cable and pins quality looks good.Since i couldnt find original cable for 65w charger of realme i was searching for long time for a good one...,Charging speed depends on number of factors and only in best condition it will go above 50 watts and the brand only claims that 65 watts fast charge if only you use the brand's inbox charger . For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. üëçüèª,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it's super product and 3 year's of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one. This wire has a good build quality and can do 65 watts (6.5a).",

Also, YOU CANNOT CONNECT 2 PCs USING A MALE TO MALE USB. THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. Stop writing negative reviews after using this cable for something that it was NOT intended for.Can confirm that it is ~1.2m as most other products and not 1.5m as the seller claims both in title and on stickers on the product.No review mentions this. But I needed a 1.5m length for perfect use. So disappointed as I have to rotate the cooling pad and use it (cable falls short by around 15cm).,It works well. The cable is soft and flexible.

    "reviewContent": "Hi all, firstly, I was very skeptical to purchase TV through online. Secondary, Iam a big fan of Sony and LG brands., Thirdly,as I have 4 year old kid at home I was so scared to spend money beyond 15k. Ofcourse at the first day sale for prime members when the Amazon great Indian festival started, I saw one Plus and Hisense A6H were priced at under 20k including bank offers and my favourite Sony 43inch was priced at 35k. But discarded Sony just bcz of expensive and scared if my kid whilst playing will break it. So I was continuously searching for budget friendly TVs like TCL, Redmi Nokia and Iffalcon but didn't like the 32 inch TV. Suddenly out of the blue on Thursday that is on 20 October I saw this blowing offer on Hisense Vivid 4K TV but scared to buy, but I felt offer was tempting so took the risk and bought it for 15,740/- ( deal price 20,990... ICICI Bank credit card instant discount 5,250/-) so technically bought it for 15740/- so I felt worth the risk and bought it. On 22nd October TV was delivered to me and immediately I raised installation request and technician came on 23October and installed the TV.That's my journey from searching to installation.Now coming to initial impressions.1- Picture - I'd say being a VA Panel, I can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind, however, colours are not over saturated, I felt they are normal and when I looked at TV from sides I can clearly say it doesn't come near to IPS panel display. But, yeah for an average user like me it's sufficient.2- Remote- It's simple, major apps hotkeys are given. YT, Amazon prime video, Hotstar which is good. voice assistant is enabled. Simple and user friendly experience. It lacks hands free Google assistant.3- Sound- I personally felt if 30 Watts audio given in the TV it would have been great, but only 24watts given which is crisp and clear though I increased volume upto 70 to chk, but no distortions nothing it's clear dialogues and Bass, but if a soundbar is added it will be added advantage.4- UI- It comes with Android 9 it doesn't matter to me as I'm a very average user so runs the show for me, I hope Hisense sends the OTA update5-Now to the main point as u can see my pictures, I see specially in Amazon prime video app, on the blue screen there are some lines which I don't know whether it's problem with panel or application. Need to chk with Amazon customer service for the reason. If any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super.6- Conclusion - Frankly speaking i bought this TV only bcz I got it almost under 15000(bought for 17520/- including extended warranty for 2+2 years) bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it won't pinch me . So from my perspective I felt it's okay with some minor issues like sound. I just need to get clarity on that prime video issue. If that is sorted I will be happy.Happy Diwali to team.,I have bought this tv at 18,990.00 and at this price tag its a great purchase.picture quality is good not at per with sony or lg 4k tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi VU etc. VA Pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacks.Pros:Android TVSoundColourCons:Remote,Loved the picture quality,Average picture quality but ok for this price,Worth for the cost. Nice quality and clarity,Good,Good product,Good support team as unit reached within 11 hours installation done within time of installer called. Demo properly given. And company call also received in 3 days for confirmation of material delivery and installation done proper way .",

    "reviewContent": "Seems OK. Have not tried it with HD quality videos. Value for money.,Very high and in budget hdmi cable by amazon basic,Nice,I bought this for my android tv stick and it works very good with it.Quality of the cable is very good and rich.It doesn't lose the picture and sound quality of TV stick,It is working as expected,I purchased splitter but it didn‚Äôt work properly and ordered for hdmi male female wire which helped me to view sources properly,Good. Serves the purpose. Had to buy this as for some weird reason the amazon firestick (bern working for 3 years) is no longer working when connected to my Samsung TVs HDMI port (all 4 ports). Searching in google did not help as this issue seem to be common with Samsung TVs but with no possible solution. So wanted to check if the firestick works in my computer monitor but the HDMI slot in the monitor was unreachable for a direct connection and hence bought this cable. The firestick worked well with monitor. What's even weirder is the firestick works fine when connected to the same Samsung TV using this cable. Problem solved, although no clue how the hell it got fixed :),The quality of this cable is quite good. Been using it for a couple of months now, to connect a laptop or a desktop to a Dell monitor. Picture quality for Full HD works fine along with sound output, not sure about 4K though since I don't have a 4K monitor. Price should be less than Rs. 250 which I paid, should be in the Rs. 100/- to Rs. 150/- considering the quality and other alternative products available in the brick and mortar stores. If you are willing to pay a bit extra then this is just fine.",

    "reviewContent": "My LG smart 4K TV‚Äôs magic remote went kaput and since LG‚Äôs magic remotes are super pricey I decided to give this one a try. Besides the air mouse and motion gestures everything else works absolutely fine.Also the lightweight remote and its form factor feels really nice and cozy in hands. However the buttons have no dots or rivets over its buttons which sometimes makes you forget which key you are pressing.Other than that its a great remote controller.,This product is good for work from my box TV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XuQNA3jRL._SY88.jpg,After having my original magic remote go kaput, I was not sure if this remote would work on my 55inch LG smart TV. However, a huge relief, it works and works like a smooth operator using the keys.  No need of any set up etc. It doesn't have voice or scroll button, but I anyways was not using that feature in my original magic remote, since that consumes batteries to a great extent forcing you to change batteries every 4 days. Don't waste money buying expensive ones, go for this.,Functionally very good, and it is a good replacement for the original remote, on which the power switch had stopped working. I haven't had to use most of the other functions.,Good performance,Cheap and best alternative for your lg remote. Magic mouse option is not there but works fine with my lg tv,Works as expected. The response is little slow but that's still fine.",

    "review": "Wonderful TV and Awful installation service from amazon,Acer Television Review,It's a good product for that price.,Good for the price,Almost a complete package,Nice Product,Good product,Super designed",
    "reviewContent": "About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It's awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can't use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It's running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it's good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money",

Very good product. If you want to avoid the cable this is a best product.,Eco Dot 3rd,Product does its work but quality can be improved. Edges are not smooth and is made of poor quality plastic. No shine but dull outlook. Still ok to buy in this price.,The product correctly holds the Echo Dot as well as the cables without hindering the flat placement on the wall. The position of the holder can be shifted slightly as well (in terms of distance from the wall) because the holder can slide on the adapter.

    "review": "Works flawlessly on Ubuntu 22.04 (if installed correctly),Best for kali. Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 ‚Ä¶,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product",
    "reviewContent": "I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for \"morrownr/8821au-20210708\" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product \"TP-Link AC600\" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don‚Äôt support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.",

There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place. Get the model with antenna because otherwise you'll have range problems if you're not directly in line of sight from your wifi router.,The wifi dongle is a simple plug & play device, will start catching available networks right after you plug it into your USB port, no additional installations/ softwares requires.

This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever.

    "review": "An unbiased look at the Kodak TV,Sound good,It's really worthy and the most affordable,Not bad!!!,a value TV for the price,Good in all respect,Kodak tv,Smart tv",
    "reviewContent": "I recently purchased the Kodak TV from Amazon and overall, my experience has been satisfactory. The picture quality is good and the streaming capabilities are convenient. The user interface is easy to navigate, although it did take me a little bit of time to get used to it.However, I do have a few issues with the TV. The sound quality is not the best and I have noticed some lag when switching between apps. These issues do not significantly impact my viewing experience, but they are worth mentioning.Despite these issues, I would still give the Kodak TV 3 stars out of 5. It is a decent TV for the price, but there are certainly better options out there. I was offered an additional 3 months of warranty if I wrote a review, but I am not particularly interested in extending the warranty at this time.It is not appropriate or ethical to write a false or misleading review in exchange for incentives, such as an extended warranty or other perks. Doing so goes against Amazon's guidelines and can lead to consequences for both the customer and the company.It is important to be honest and transparent in your reviews and to only write about your genuine experiences with a product. This helps other customers make informed decisions about their purchases and ensures that the review system remains fair and trustworthy.If you are not satisfied with the Kodak TV or do not feel comfortable giving it a high rating, it is perfectly okay to give it a lower rating or to not write a review at all. It is always better to be honest and genuine in your reviews, rather than attempting to manipulate the system for personal gain.,Issues with chrome casting,I did not believe such a good feature would be available at this price.  I liked the feature of supporting the Ethernet port and earphone jack.,Kodak tv,For the amount being charged, this is a acceptable TV.The Kodak 7XPRO  model is same as Thomson 9A series.Despite being 32\" big, this was lighter than my previous Bravia 18\" TV and easily mounted to the previous wall-mount. Note: The wall mount holes are plasticky and dont have any metal insert.The remote sensor is separate module projecting from the underside of the TV and does not look integrated  with the main body.The two USB ports are side by side which dont interfere with each other.The Audio out port is a good feature if one wants to watch TV without disturbing others.When i first connected the TV to my set-top box over HDMI, there was only picture and no sound.The person at the service center whose number is listed on the TV's warranty card said that they dont support this and i need to call the TV manufacturer. so much for printing a service center number on warranty card.This was fixed after changing the HDMI CEC settings in the set-top box (not TV's fault).There is no user-manual given with the TV. most people, based on their experience with phone should be able to ultimately figure out the connections. The only included leaflet-book (whose pages were all stuck together) talks about the Android menu, There is no info on the TV's input jacks (like what the HDMI ARC stands for).I got multiple calls after the purchase to enquire about delivery and if i needed installation.As i already had a previous wall mount on which this could get attached with no hassles, I opted out of installation service.,All is welllll,Good tv,Picture quality is very good",

    "reviewContent": "The cable does support fast PD charging, I have tried it on my laptop, and also tried it on the powerbank.Tested on the Samsung 45watt charger and it worked fine for the phone, tried the same on charger on laptop for PD charging, though it charged the laptop but the cable point does heat up quite a bit. So there are chances that if a 100 watt charger is used, it may heat up a lot. Overall the cord is well make, very sturdy and the materials indicate that this cord will be very very durable. The price would could have been on the lower side due to heating otherwise its a good buy.,Good for buy,Like it,I got this for my samsung s10 lite and it is compatible with super fast charger and charged my phone in Super fast charge mode. Value for money. Could not post picture but product is good. Far better than original Samsung cable which cost almost same.,The cable is sterdy, the ends are premium. Charges my One Plus 7T rapidly. Great data transfers on my Macbook as well. I am happy with the purchase.,Good cable,Worth it. Quality of cable is very good. Supports fast charging in Samsung Galaxy devices,Ideal for charging but not for data transfer.(gives an average speed of 30 to 35mbps with my ssd capable of more than 100mbps transfer speed and actually gives with its provided cable)",

The TV uses WebOS. its snappy. its so so feature rich. The magic remote is amazing. It supports Samsung Smartview and DEX out of the box which means without any internet and wifi etc you can directly cast your screen. Super handy. The sound quality is just so so great for the price. The Remote gets synced with the Airtel DTH and there is dual band support. The HDR gets detected and auto upscaled for Full HD contents in the Hotstar and Netflix. The only cons I find is the power usage which is 100Watt and the smart assistant is pretty useless. The WebOS btw has all essential apps.About VU: Installation is done same day. i cant comment on the durability and future support now. But thats common for all TV comps today except Samsung, LG, Sony and Panasonic.,All fine but remote is a pain. It's too ergonomically faulted for elderly people. Also webos is not the greatest and user friendly.,Good,Really good product overall, bit different from android tv but work almost simler to google or android tv.only feedback is screen mirror feels little bit legging and it would be good if we get mx player in store.,While placing Orders, I asked for Exchange of old Samsung 32‚Äù TV, And 2 years Extended Warranty for New TV.  This has Not Come with Delivery.,I like all the features but login for ott apps is a problem which we have to open chrome in mobile or laptop for login in tv",

    "review": "VFM and kudos to egate to launch a fhd projector at the lowest price and it is not bad at all,Good Bluetooth Projector,What more can you ask for at this price!!?,Good for winter nights.,Nice purchase,Value for money,WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT...,Value for money",
    "reviewContent": "This review is for the native FHD projector.Yes, it is a native 1080p led projector. connected this to my desktop computer and tested also. Dont bother trying to play videos from USB. Quality is bad.But when connected to right streaming or display source thru hdmi, it is actually quite good. I mean picture quality, colours, brightness etc for a sub 10k projector. In this department this projector can easily compete with many projectors in sub 15k ranges.Sound is also pretty much okay, loud enough more like boat 5w speakers, may be a bit more louder not good quality wise. Quitr workable as portable solution, but not for a permanent setup.Audio output to my studio headphones are pretty decent quality wise and loud also. Meaning 2.1 speakers can be connected to it, for a higher setup, person has to figure out to seperate the audio at the source itself.From 9ft and 3-4 inches distance of lens to wall, we can get exactly 100 inch(87 inch x 49 inch) projection. So, it can be called as short throw projector, albiet may be border level. There is an option to reduce the screen size upto 75% of original size electronically once connected to HDMI.Keystone correction is not usuable at all. That wheel has to be exatly in middle position to get a good focus on whole screen.That means one has to setup the projector or screen at a fixed location. Can not lilt the projector to move screen up or down and then adjust with keystone correction. I. e if you want to keep the projector screen at lower levels, projector also has to fixed at lower levels only. Best focus can be get, when projecting exactly oppsite to the projector probably 5 to 6 inch above, so if we flip the projector upside down, we get best focus opposite to center a few inches down.For mysetup, where projecting only 1.5 feet above from the floor, going to use a wall mount to setup the projector upside down, this way i can fix the projector a bit more above/behind the sofa. I will post the pics later, once it is setup properly.Now the verdict - this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen( look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand) is one of most vfm combo for approx 11k for experiencing a very bright 100 inch screen experience of good quality for 1 or 2 person.  But now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of 15k to 30k, im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projector(look only ANSI value). This buy was more of an impulse purchase, but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projector.Edit: the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel, which impacts the clarity also after a few days. I had to clean the panel myselg just after 1.5 month.  New lesson learnt, apart from high ansi lumen projector, this is also an important factor for future purchase. Planning to get a custom cloth cover made, so that i dont have to clean it often. Though, Lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model. Somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet. Only the lcd has very very fine dust particles inside.,Quality is good, value for Money. Bluetooth Connectivity is smooth and fast. The sound quality of the Projector is not so great but that we had already considered before. Hotstar App really works nicely with great quality, and so does Youtube. Netflix & Prime video doesn't give the same quality initially, but that must be wifi connection. Some apps however don't get installed, or just close on their own.The good point is the Bluetooth connection, and even we have added a Bluetooth soundbar, so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good option.,This is indeed a fantastic product in this price range.it is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through HDMIneedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day i.e. if you can cover up your windows and other light sources.Screen spread is Almost up to 120 inch at a throw distance of 13 to 1 feet with the sharpness more or less intact.converts 4K to 1080PWill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mine.ensure that the walls are white for best image / video reproduction.Definitely recommended at this price point.ConsOnly vertical Keystone correction available,Projector is good so far as it used for last 3 days. May revisit the feedback after a couple of months.,I bought this projector for my classroom and it‚Äôs very helpful for their studies. Now students connect themselves more to the world.üòä,I feel It's a value for money product as I have already used it for last two months.,If u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further..... THIS IS IT...!!! BEST IN PRICE, GOOD PICTURE QUALITY, BRIGHTNESS AND A DECENT REMOTE WITH GOOD FUNCTIONALITY... As always premium buyers avoid as these r for normal home with normal needs... Very good for family get together, movie nights and kids will be awe struck at its enormity... I've canceled my dth connection Coz AMAZON PRIME TV STICK WITH THIS PROJECTOR IS ALL I NEED... THAT'S ALL THE TIME I HAVE FOR WATCHING TV AMIDST MY WORK AND THEY DO THE JOB WELL... An entertaining night after a busy day n you will be done satisfied... Any queries ping me I'll help u as much as i can... Don't worry abt specs and other details takeit from a family man,it will satisfy all ur needs,be it surfing, movies or gaming and with fire tv stick mirroring is possible too... Hope it helps...UPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS - 4HRS/DAY USAGE :The pic uploaded was by noon 1pm with dark screens...HI, THIS WAS A REPLY TO A CUSTOMER TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN EGATE I9 N UC 68 & 46,  BUT I THOUGHT IF THIS WAS PUT UP IN UPDATE SECTION A LOT WOULD BENEFIT SO HERE IT GOES...First u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if it's for offic use or home entertainment, also u didn't mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc... since u have not i'll go with a general review for purposes... IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY DETAILED REVIEW SO GUYS WITH OUT PATIENCE CAN RUN TO THE END AT ONCE...!!!I too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i9 from uc 68 & 46... Let me tell u what helped me decide...First n foremost egate is an Indian company unlike uc which is a common Chinese product with a namesake brand UC (confirmed it with my friend in China)... Hence service n general trust is more on egate than competition...Secondly, from fellow customers, I've learnt that egate is brighter than the rest two...Thirdly, the images are sharp and there's no blur on text on egate compared to the other two... Just learn to adjust the keystone properly...Fourth, the length of the power cord is longer in egate...Fifth, it's got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use... The others don't have it...Now in general I've not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users, so I'm gonna tell u wat I've done n wat else u can do with egate...I've placed it at a length of 15 feet from the screen n it gives awesome display... Connect a 2.1 /5.1 home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at 2/3 feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping around...I've connected my SECOND FIRE TV Stick, with it so it connects to Wi-Fi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n FF... Also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etc...U get a remote which functions well along with it...MOST IMPORTANTLY, U CAN CEILING MOUNT IT OR TRIPOD IT TOO WHICH THE OTHER TWO CANT... BUT remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by 180¬∞ in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod it's not necessary...Also u can place the projector behind the screen LIKE AN ACTUAL THEATRE IF U R USING A CLOTH SCREEN LIKE ME N CONSTRAINT OF SPACE, BUT REMEMBER TO FLIP THE IMAGE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IN SETTINGS AS THE PROJECTOR IS BEHIND THE SCREEN N U NEED TO GET A 90¬∞ FLIPPED IMAGE FROM BEHIND...so I guess it's the 3d part that made ur decision murky, wat I would love to say for that is I've a Samsung 3d enabled smart tv n I've seen the output of these kind of cheap 3d devices too, since its a low cost projector 3d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a TV if 3d is a priority, as in TV the 3d effects r awesome... But nowadays u can install an APP IN ANY DEVICE to watch 3d movies or better download a 3d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur 3d glasses... My friends do it but I DON'T...VERDICT : \"BEST PROJECTOR IN MARKET IN MY OPINION FOR THE PRICE AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSE\"NOTE : FOR AMAZON PRIME N NETFLIX USERS, IF U R USING A 2.1 AUDIO OUTPUT SOMETIMES U MIGHT NOT GET AUDIO SO DONT GET WORRIED N ITS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROJECTOR ITS JUST THAT THE LATEST MOVIES ARE MADE WITH DOLBY 5.1 SOUND SO JUST USE THE ON SCREEN SETTING IN THE VIDEO TO NAVIGATE TO SOUND N CHOOSE STEREO FROM THE DEFAULT DOLBY OPTION & VOILA U R DONE...!!!HOPE IT HELPS, PING ME FOR ANY DOUBTS...HIT LIKE, IF MY REVIEW WAS USEFUL...!!!,As per money it's bestBut if you are fan of pictures qualityThink about budget",

    "reviewContent": "I purchased the cable for my Galaxy Note 9 in July 2022. Have been using it since and it works neat. The cable is tough due to its braided nature.,Overall good for usage, not faced any quality issues. C point section is also good to fit properly in mobile. You can go for it.,Most expensive cable I have ever purchased. Probably the best cable too. Giving 1 star less for the premium pricing.I bought this as the long cables dont work well with Android Car. This works very well. Go for it if you have to connect with Android Auto.,Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ‚Çπ309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won't come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars, I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use, the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ‚Çπ300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality, the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle, I am sure I will put it through some abuse and I can comment on the same when I revisit this review for updates.Durability:I will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective, as my first Wayona dash charge cable I used for Oneplus 6 died in 3 months. But thankfully it was replaced under warranty. That shows how good the support is from Wayona team. I only had to record that the cable died and doesn't charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the product.Verdict:If you are looking for a short cable for mobiles on  or for charging devices from powerbanks, I would definitely recommend this cable.,Data transfer is quite fast, and also, compatible with my QC adapter.,Good,Excellent... Worth for the money,Nice wire, fast charge.",

No issues so far.,As per Belkin product page, there is NO mention that it supports 60W. Belkin support in Q/A section says it supports only 15W.

    "review": "Tv working good.,Value of money,Acer 32  Sound bar tv review,product is good but one lie by the seller (i.e. 16GB space),Cromecast not working in this smart TV.,Awesome clarity and sound,Awesome sound system like a sound bar picture quality is impressive and connected good,Budget friendly Smart TV",
    "reviewContent": "Tv working good, the screen is VA type, if we want to see good picture we need to maintain minimum distance to tv because this tv pixels are so big. But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV's colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved. This tv have sound bar and it's sounds great compared to other tv brands especially in this price range. I will recommend this tv if you want to buy this 32 inch S series tv.,Writing  review after 1.5 month use overall good but it become little slow when we install apps rest everything is fine. I liked it and i think you also love it if your budget is in this range.,First fall I was take as buy a acer tv, then I have fear because acer tv is new brand and if any problem with tv serving. But after purchased and  using my fear was goes. Because tv functions is good. And warranty also available.,Overall its a  good product, some times it lags and once it got auto restarted.but company has lied to customers with that there is 16 gb of space in the TV which is not therestill i like the picture and sound quality,I am very happy when I order this tv. I have purchased it on Diwali. When we start to use this tv, we found that to use the cromecast feature I need to install a third party app which is not support to my mobile phone (samsung M21). I am very disappointed now  for this feature but what can i do now. It has good and loud sound system. My overall experience is not meet to my expectations.,I regret not having gotten a larger size. This is an amazing smart tv, clear view and awesome sound. 4 stars only because I couldnt get jio universal remote to work with it.,Under 15k best smart Android TV everything is perfect  like sound, picture quality, Bluetooth connectivity and wifi. Connectivity,Finally a budget friendly smart TV  for middle class people who is having 30k salary per month. Picture quality- Ok Ok,  Sound- super, warnty- best, remote - simple over all nice one. No product is perfect in all segments, this one also not an exception.",

Will definitely recommend this one.,Good Product, worth of buying,After installing new fiber at my place i got to know that my wifi reciever in my PC was not capable of reciving 5g speed. So i have ordered this from amazon. This is an amazing product which is working totally fine till now.Only problem is they do not instruct that you have to plug this in usb 3.0 port to receive 5g speed. It will recieve only 4g on usb 2.0..  over all best product and nice range,Good,I am using this product for the last couple of months now. It was really easy to install and easy to use. My laptop is an old one and is not compatible with 5Ghz bandwidth, hence I had to look for a Wifi adapter and I stumbled upon this and I don't regret buying it. It is working as per my expectation and I am able to utilize the 5Ghz network on my laptop now. A must-buy for anyone having an issue with 5Ghz bandwidth. It's a lifesaver.,I used to have wifi6 on my laptop, now I‚Äôm using this dongle with wifi5 and frankly, I did not notice a difference.,I just connect with my iPhone hotspot to pc nd it‚Äôs so nice very fast,Hello guys I bought this product from Amazon and it was a very fast delivery as It was easy installation  less than two Minutes  it gives the best signal of 5G and 4G so it won‚Äôt be hassle to install it‚Äôs the product for guys who don‚Äôt have Wi-Fi adapters in the systems.

    "review": "Wonderful TV and Awful installation service from amazon,Acer Television Review,It's a good product for that price.,Good for the price,Almost a complete package,Nice Product,Good product,Super designed",
    "reviewContent": "About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It's awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can't use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It's running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it's good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money",

    "reviewContent": "Cable is long and durable. Its worth the purchase.,I recommend this product whoever needs a sturdy and fast charging also keep in mind your charger needs to support while using this cable,After seeing the reviews I ordered for this product for my Samsung S9 mobile. Although the cable is very steady and good it fails the main purpose. When I keep my mobile for charging the cable pin is very tight and I fear while putting and removing my mobile charging chip would break as it is very tight. I am looking for another alternative.So if you are looking for a charger for S9 Samsung mobile PLEASE FO NOT BUY IT.,Good,Superb,I have oneplus 6 mobile phone and have dash charger and oneplus cable which becomes a fast charging combo.However when i plugged in this cable with dash charger. It was not rapidly charging my phone. So I can't say if this is fast charging cable ot not.But as a common charging cable this is working perfectly fine,This is one of the best cable for fast charging. I have 3 units of 2 meter c type cable. I don't think it will get damage soon. The quality is very good and charging S22 ultra, Galaxy note 8 etc without any problem. Thanks to China,Standard Product. Worth the money.....",

With a flick of hand it might get bent as my last charging chord got to be so i had to buy this one. Something must be done about that.,Very good worth the money,I had to replace the cable that I had recieved with my laptop. I opted Zoul and am highly satisfied by the cable. It's durable and works seamlessly.,This is an amazing product from Zoul. I bought many other cables before from other brands but they didn't work that well. But this, I must say is the Best of all in terms of charging power, durability and sturdiness. Much Recommend!!,I've been using this cable for over 6 months with my Galaxy S22 it's been working flawlessly. Fast charging works as expected and the 2m length makes it convenient to use it in bed. Would recommend to anyone looking for a long cable. Infact, my brother purchased one after seeing me buy it.,The cable has good length, charges very fast,",

    "reviewContent": "I got this for 6k. At this price point, I believe the TV provides decent quality. You shouldn't expect amazing quality anyway from a 1366x768 screen resolution. The audio is also okay. Beyond 50 the audio starts cracking.From a viewing distance of 6-8ft the quality looks good.PLEASE NOTE: you will STRUGGLE quite a bit to directly add a firestick to the HDMI port. They have given some other ports right next to the HDMI ports because of which the firestick doesn't have proper space to fit properly unless you really shove it in there. My suggestion is to get an HDMI extender for it.Overall, I'd say, for a small room, it's a 7/10.,Value for money, Satisfied with the product till now,This Led tv low budget Good üëç Performance but picture & audio not good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/61QvXYP2McL._SY88.jpg,Good,Tv is great but the installation guy asked me for 400‚Çπ paid installation... Misleading information but again for this price it's good tv. Don't pay installation guy you can do it yourself,,I will give it 4 stars out of 5. I bought this 32 inch VW at 6150 after discounts. Picture quality and sound quality is good.I added firestick to it and it voila became smart tv. The connections to attach these usbs are at the bottom part of the tv which is slightly different from other tvs.So far, working as it should.Revising this after 9 days, the tv is not responding to switch off button. This is happening more when i watch the tv for a few hours and then when i switch off the tv with the firestick remote, the yellow colour indicator down below does not turn red, instead it remains yellow. As far as screen is concerned, the tv's screen changes to black whitish, seems to me that the tv goes into hibernation or sleep mode. This is a fault of the tv as a normal tv should swith off completely and the indicator should turn red. i have called technician tomorrow and if he checks and if he agrees, then i should get a replacement as i got still 2 days time to replace it.Just a helping note for people buying this tv: if you are going to connect firestick to it, as it asks for the brand name of the tv, you can select VU and it will perfectly work on your firestick. Thanks and enjoy!",

    "review": "Best(Branded) Budget TV,A high-quality 4k Smart TV from Samsung,Received Defective,Got Replacement,Nice product but,Tv is good,Best budget tv,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product",
    "reviewContent": "Before finalizing the AUE60 55\", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55\" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I'll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV's speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a VA panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I'd say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung's SmartThings App, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV's design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I'd say I'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. It's a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I'd highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. I don't require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. It also lacks base.Purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,But the picture quality is ok-ok.,Best tv product in given price range,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product",

This item was glued at the edges,,Good but fits loose at top, bit tight at bottom. But still, Can go with the purchase.,This fits the Samsung Smart TV Remote perfectly, All edges are covered too, so if you do drop you remote from a decent height, it will not let the remote get scratched or cracked but you can't expect it to save you from all kinds of drops.I believe I needed it because my kid keeps dropping the remote and I was worried because the Samsung Smart Remote is quite expensive. It even fits the slightly tilted shape of the remote quite perfectly.,Product is good as described and fitted perfectly very smoothly. Thanks amazon,A good product in a higher price side,Average ok ok quality,Fit can be better as side portions are loose and might reduce overall cover's life as kids put finger and small items into it. However the top and lower portions are tight enough to meet the purpose. Luminous blue gives a decent glow when its in pitch dark.",

After 5-6 months, Cable stopped PC connectivity.... Then after a month it started showing problems in charging... It used to charge in one position only, and charging used to stop with little movement...Finally had to replace it with new one after 6-7 months....Since the price is now reduced to 300, so I will say good product in this price... Not long lasting... If you want a reliable, long lasting, long length cable , go for original from oneplus showroom....--------------------------(Initial review written just after purchase)Yes, it supports dash charge, and no heating issues... (Using it since 3 days).One NEGATIVE point is short length... It is 1 meter long ... Original cable is 1.5 meters... So it is difficult to use my phone while charging.....Other NEGATIVE point I can figure out is that cable is really hard... In my experience hard cables break more often than soft pliable ones... It is not easy to put a hard cable in my bag without putting strain on it (for daily commute to office)... this makes them to break easily before time.....Hard cables are also not easy to use when the mobile is charging... It puts strain on both the points, the charger side and mobile side, which again makes it vulnerable to cracks...This raises a question on longevity of the cable.....Let's do some calculations.....My original OnePlus cable lasted for 2 years, cost of which at present is Rs.1100.... it was soft, easy to bend and keep in my bag while traveling daily for work.... The Rs.1100 cable online is 1.5 meters long, which makes it easy to work on phone while it is plugged.....Popio cable costs Rs.400 at present (but they show it 999 , which means price may rise) ... So, even if it lasts for 6-8 months, it will be more costly to me than an original cable in 2 years... Popio cable is 1 meter long, against 1.5 meters of original cable... So effective price of popio cable is Rs.500 for 1.5 meter cable...Popio cable is 1 meters long against 1.5 meters of original cable... Which makes it not easy to use the phone while it is charging.... Using a short cable while charging puts strain on the cable and phone's charging port, which is damaging for both, and also decreases life of both the cable and charging port.....They say you have to consider cost while writing review... But you should also consider cost on long run, not just the immediate cost.... ..So, if u are thinking of changing your phone in coming future and don't want to spend too much on cable, Popio is the best option available....But, if you are looking for a long term solution, and you can afford to buy Rs.1100 cable, I will suggest to go for the original one.... It has more length, it is soft, and it lasts longer with moderate use...,I ordered this cable for 330/- in the sale yesterday. When i plugged in the cable it wasn't charging Rapidly on my OnePlus. But then immediately i booked for a replacement cable which arrived this morning and i plugged it in and voila! \"Charging Rapidly \" Thankful,2nd purchase review....Purchased on 17 July 2019, dash charge STOPPED WORKING on 15 September 2019...

Also, i use my Ipad primarily for gaming, so it is almost always connected to my pc while gaming.So, i needed a really sturdy cable, that could charge, sync and and feel good while doing it.And this cable does the job perfectly!!It is sturdy. My ipad has taken a few drops my table and was saved my this cable. Even after 3 months of daily abuse, this cable has no signs of wear and tear.The charge speed is the same as the original apple cable. And so is the sync speed.One thing this cable does better than the original cable is the connection quality. It hardly ever accidentally breaks the connection while moving around too much, which was a problem with my original cable.I'm very satisfied with the purchase and i even have a spare one in case of an emergency.,Quality cable material. It feels durable. Charges my iPhone just fine. Thanks Amazon.,,,The product is good, build quality is good and does what's said in the description of the product. But it stopped working within 6 months of usage. The prod was ordered in Apr 22 and now in Sept 22 its  not charging the phone at all.I have contacted Amazon for the same and looking forward for their help.,Used it as a back up to charge phone in car. Apple car play has stopped working intermittently when using this cable,Good product but phn was getting heat while its chrgeing,This cable is working great. It‚Äôs durable and charging power is also good.Recommendedüëç",

    "review": "Almost Perfect!,Review After using 1month,Nice tv,Panel and video quality,Good Product,Worth for money,Nice,Good",
    "reviewContent": "Update after 9 months of use:1. The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It's as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates, the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube, Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that's an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However, after using it for 2 months, the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now, up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes, I set brightness to 0, and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,a. it often gets disconnected from wifi - have to restart it againb. prime video fails to resume - displays error - and have to restart the TV againc. On the home screen, you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first. You can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first - easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itself.,Only Cons till now got, fast moving object looks blurr, which was known before buying by other user review, but i got this tv in 32 k,Ao over all satishfied,Only minus that too critical is the installation service provider.The product is to installed by v care installation services provider.The installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properly.Actual date of installation was on 21.02.22 but was only done by the service provider on 27.10.22.The executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and don't know how to behave to the customer.He behaved very rudely.The installation service provider is a total damage and waste. Not at all worth.,,Awesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tv.,Dolby atom 4 k video etc,Good,Good",

    "reviewContent": "I'm using it for Dell 22-inch monitor and I found it difficult to fit, hence I had to visit the fabrication shop to smoothen the corners else it is really good,,Good,Quality of the product is good. But it didn't clearly suit the Samsung monitor I have. I had to remove a specific part behind the monitor and adjusted this wall mount. Till now no issue.,Product is good. I am using Benq ex2780q monitor. Holds well enough but there are only 2 places to screw it in. This makes you doubt sometimes weather this can hold up the weight of the monitor. I have been using it for the past 2 months and haven't faced any issue.Another problem with this montioe is the rubber that is used for rotating the montioe is cheap and gets broken initially only. But replaced with proper nuts and this worked fine for meFinal verdict: good monitor wall mount easily taking 5kg of weight on it.Could have been better if the rubber material and count of screw holes in the wall mount be more,Great product at reasonable rate. Very easy to install. Very sturdy product. Never feel like monitor will fall down.üëçüèª,Self install a bit difficult. The plate connecting to monitor could have been removable and drop in clamp . This would make fixing a breeze,It's doing the job well. My 27\" monitor is holding it firmly on the wall.",

    "reviewContent": "Good,Using it for Samsung Z Fold 4 with an Ambrane 30W charger.Fast charging works. Side on design is very practical.Sturdy build. Well worth the money.,Very useful,Very nice in this price range,The cable quality is great and its built well, both sides are L shaped connectors ( 1 side of the cable should have been regular as L shaper port blocks other ports and if you have a mobile stand you can't use this cable.Its very bad for data transfer even a 1 gb file takes 5 or more minutes.Great for charging, supports fast charging as well. If you want a cable just for charging your phone its great.Updating review after getting a replacement, now it doesn't even fast charge my phone. Returned it.,Product is good.But sometimes there are little bit charging problem seen.It shows disconnected from charging while it is plugged in.BTW, some weeks later it eaten by our goatüòÇThen I bought one new.,Best quality cable at best price,Short review: Go for it if you are looking for a C2C charging cable at 60W or less. Sturdy and stylish with an added advantage of 90¬∞ connectors.[Deal price: ‚Çπ139]Long review:I have been using Portronics products lately and I have to appreciate the quality and innovation they bring to the end users.Products I own from Portronics: ‚Ä¢ My Buddy k3 ‚Ä¢ Brillo 3 ‚Ä¢ Power Plate 7 ‚Ä¢ Mobot one ‚Ä¢ Clamp M ‚Ä¢ Konnect LAll the products I bought from Portronics not just met my expectations but they performed beyond that. It made me start building trust on the brand.I use S21 ultra which can be charged at 25W and this cable supports the same with the Samsung's original charger. I strongly believe the product would work at the rated power delivery (60W).It looks and feels sturdy and I am expecting it to be durable too.The 90¬∞ ends keep the cables away without out interfering with the work space. Works the best when playing battle royale games as the cable won't come in the way.The grey and black colour combination works as a charm and would blend in with Apple devices.Data transfer speeds are yet to be tested. I will update here once I have enough inputs on the same.After using multiple cables from Ambrane, Wayona, Wecool, and more brands Portronics definitely stands as a good contender for all of them that serve the same purpose.Verdict: I would definitely recommend this Type-c to Type-c cable if you need to charge devices at 60W or less.",

Village people are really looted a lot from these installation people, so called Engineers.One day I was checking Google and found this set-up box with 1000rs and shocked and felt it was some joke.Then after approaching Amazon i got to realise it is true.And i ordered one box for my 55inch LG UHD TV as they expected so called Engineers  never came on time.And i had a call with customer support to get it cancelled. Then they responded and came to deliver and installing.These engineers are really talented and started adding prices for every thing that i have already paid. ex. Remote, Wire, Antenna.They started charging for every little thing. There i got to realise, how these people looting uneducated or unaware people.So please be aware when ever you are purchasing any product check and ask questions for everything.Product Review:  Product is upto my mark. Quality of the video and HD channels with a less price is really amazing. Tata sky is the mark of materials and picture quality software is really great and easy to use.,Thank you",

    "reviewContent": "Amazon should provide 2 mtr cable length, very good quality,Nice item, received in good packaging.,The cables is perfectly working and there is no color difference with it.,It works perfectly with GTX 1650 Super (Asus TUF) and DELL 2520D with single desktop across dual monitor setup (multi-stream). The trick to figuring out is how the cable fits your DP port, both sides. This fit in snugly with GTX and I knew this is gonna work. No need to do any voodoo with pulling cables, powering off this and that, to make DP cable work, just works straight out of the box.Strangely, this cable didn't support my Logitech G603 (wireless gaming mouse) Lightspeed connection. The dongle is attached to the 1st of the two DELL 2520D Monitors. Mouse works when I am viewing over Type-C PD Display with my Laptops. Otherwise Audio, Video, resolution , refresh rates didn't bother.Durability could be a question, let's wait and observe over the days. A lot have commented that this cable didn't last long.,Best in the budget.,This is not Vesa certified cable. sometimes the monitor  goes black for 3 to 4 second.,,The product is good, Its been almost a week I am using this cable. I am using a LG 24GM77 Monitor (1080p 144Hz) As soon as I installed this cable the display went on default refresh rate (60 Hz). Then I went into windows display settings (as Nvidia settings didn't have refresh rate more than 60 Hz) to change the refresh rate to 144 Hz and it switched without any issues. Avoid jerks to the monitor as I figured the display goes off for a brief 1 or 2 secs post jerking. Rest the cable quality is good, However locks to the display ports could be appreciated. Rest all is fine. I hope this review might be helpful. Thank you.",

Charging time is good with availability of different cable types.,Considering the price compared to competitors at market, this is cheap, but no compromises have been made with respect to sturdiness or quality. The wires are wonderful, despite using it for more over a month now, no issues at all were faced regarding wire tangling, torn out wires etc. Very sturdy and pretty easy to carry.Regarding charging speed, it delivers what it promised. The quality of the ports are also solid, no issue had been faced at all.Packaging was great, performance of the product even greater. The wires are long enough, though in my personal opinion, a little bit more lengthy would be icing on the cake, making the product absolutely a perfect one!Overall, very happy with purchasing it. A great VFM product for all those having multiple type devices with them. This one single cable has a solution to charging it all!,Warp Charge is working fine and satisfactory. Lightning cable is working in normal condition rather than Fats charging.But overall the product is awesome and felt 100% value for money.,like",

    "reviewContent": "Good Packaging.. Wire Quality is Good.,Very good quality but the wire is 15 meters only at least should be 20 meters for the price......üòì,I am using this with an F&D A140x as my satellite speakers' wires were getting very flimsy. Out of the box these cables are very thick compared to the ones my speakers had before.After replacing the cables with these ones I noticed two things right away1. My speakers are louder2. The sound quality is much betterOne thing you wanna be careful is that these cables stick out like a sore thumb in front of white walls, so if you are like me who cares about the looks, you might wanna cover these with cable raceways or even paint them like I am planning to do.,Wire is very best quality but cost not worth for it,Durability n quality is absolutely good.,The product is 16 gauge pure copper multi thread wires. Sound quality is impressive.Bears a Black band for +ve/-ve distinction,I've seen many reviews where people complain that this cable is not Copper, its Aluminium and even some saying its fake. So I thought I'll clear some doubts about this product.ITS TRUE! This is not a pure Copper cable, its Copper clad Aluminium. Infact most of the speaker cables are Copper clad Aluminium. Majority of the audio signal travel through the outer edge of the conductor (skin effect), hence the Copper cladding. Thicker the cladding, better the audio quality, this cable only got a thin cladding of Copper The Steel/Aluminium reinforced center is for a more durable conductor. Now no where in the description Amazon has mentioned that this is a pure Copper cladding cable, so just need to get your expectations right. You simply cannot expect Oxygen free pure Copper cable at this price (Rs 400). You will not find a decent 16 gauge Copper speaker cable for less than Rs 2000.This is a cheap 16 gauge speaker and it does the job very well. This cable is more than enough to deliver good sound to your speakers. Cable quality is average but you get what you pay for. Now if got some high end speakers, then I won't recommend this cable.,Good",

    "reviewContent": "I purchased the cable for my Galaxy Note 9 in July 2022. Have been using it since and it works neat. The cable is tough due to its braided nature.,Overall good for usage, not faced any quality issues. C point section is also good to fit properly in mobile. You can go for it.,Most expensive cable I have ever purchased. Probably the best cable too. Giving 1 star less for the premium pricing.I bought this as the long cables dont work well with Android Car. This works very well. Go for it if you have to connect with Android Auto.,Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ‚Çπ309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won't come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars, I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use, the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ‚Çπ300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality, the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle, I am sure I will put it through some abuse and I can comment on the same when I revisit this review for updates.Durability:I will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective, as my first Wayona dash charge cable I used for Oneplus 6 died in 3 months. But thankfully it was replaced under warranty. That shows how good the support is from Wayona team. I only had to record that the cable died and doesn't charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the product.Verdict:If you are looking for a short cable for mobiles on  or for charging devices from powerbanks, I would definitely recommend this cable.,Data transfer is quite fast, and also, compatible with my QC adapter.,Good,Excellent... Worth for the money,Nice wire, fast charge.",

    "reviewContent": "My 32 inch tv fits fine, also 55 inch TV can be wall mount for sure. Good product quality. Various sizes  screws and nuts included in this product,Nice product,I am giving 3 stars because screws provide in the product do not fit properly. I had to get it separately to install.,I love to like it‚Äôs accuracy of fitting.,I had to makeshift the screws to fit the grill as the screws were long and had to add washer to make it fit.,I installed my self,It perfectly fit on my Sony TV (32 inch). Stand is sturdy and good. Deducting 1 start as I don't see anything on the sides of the stand which can prevent my TV from falling on side, so I had to little bit bend the sides of stand so that TV doesn't fall, if someone pulls it from left or right. Otherwise it's a good stand.,Nothing to write. It's a basic universal stand. Expensive here on Amazon. Turns out, the same thing was from 200 at a local hardware / electronic/light store",

    "reviewContent": "The delivery people were not careful with the unpacking. Amazon needs to train their delivery staff on unpacking different types of things since they have come up with a policy where they need to open the package and verify any defects. 2 stars to them as they are not careful with the unpacking. I could see that they were holding the TV panel while getting the TV out from the box and even after telling them to be careful they weren't. Also the stand was just thrown on the front panel cause he has nit understanding where it was at when they opened the box which could have damaged the Screen.Howerver very satisfied with the Sony Installation. The engineer has good hands on and very experienced with the installation.,TV picture quality is good. WiFi connection is little slow but it works mostly fine if router is nearby. Delivery was good and fast. The Sony installation service is very poor near Bengaluru. Guy came late, next day to scheduled day that too after calling many times. He came and went like a bullet doesn't tell most of the things about TV like need to update system and all.But overall TV works fine. We have 65 inch Bravia.,(Song TV contacted after this review and resolved all below issue Thank u sony TV)Picture  and sound quality is very good  its to good but in software so many bugs ( wifi auto connectivity issue need to connect your same  wifi again and again , sound setting after conecting sound bar need If we selected Speaker audio system then need to use 2 remotes to do sound adjustment , in My Mi TV I am using only TV remote to adjust sound and aame connectivity  same soundbar,  Unable to connect soundbar via bluetooth (IN Mi TV same sound bar connected easly)Remote size is so big so many falatu keys in remote like 1 ro 9 no keys fast forward keys etc and in down side blank space. And aftrr software update I seen little picture quality low as compare before software update.,The tv is great at this purchase price. Sony tvs are generally very adaptive. Colour and picture qualty is really good. Sound is nice as well. Would however advise to use external speakers with a tv of such size.,If you don‚Äôt wish to purchase a sound bar, go for this model. The picture quality is beautiful, works with apple play, it‚Äôs a win win. I got the 43‚Äù for my bedroom on a great offer. And yeah, it‚Äôs a Sony. A wonderful purchase, absolutely worth it.,Best TV in its segment! Outstanding built quality. Sony TV may seem little bulky compared to some other fancy TVs but I have seen over the years that they never compromise on quality.I was little skeptical about picture clarity since it is big (65\") TV but found it better than expected. Sound quality is also very good for a LED TV. Non HD channels are little less clear (not bad though; still it is good) but it's obvious seeing screen size.,Has complained on TV getting struck. Their dealer called while i was driving. Requested to call/ visit for TV reset later.Their service manager came into conference call, listened over.  He advised dealer to treat the service call as closed without issue being resolved and dealer/ service centre till date not resolved issue.  Our TV is still getting hung sometimes and we are managing by restarting tv every time,I have recently bought the 43-inch model. The picture & sound quality is good. It does not come with an anti-glare coating. Do not install the TV in front of the window.",

But this cable does around 10 to 80mbs  mostly. The cable is also very thin in size, the original Seagate had is very thick and sturdy.  At the end speed matters.so if u have like 2 or 4TB external hard drive it will load slowly after connecting, folders keep loading and loading.

    "reviewContent": ",Screen quality is good.It's been a month I bought it still working fine.Two main negatives are1‚Ä¢ It doesn't have default option to directly start on tata sky tv, we have to select hdmi option from input menu to select tata sky which one is plugged in.2‚Ä¢ dosent allow us to command/choose volume up or down from set-top box remote (mine tata sky)We have use tv remove to change the volume setting.Other than that great tv, mine ps4 works fine with it great graphics.Conclusion: If someone ask's me to if they Can buy it or notMine answer will be nor yes nor no.If we you want kinda cheap but decent  quality tv and taking the risk on unknown tv brand on their reliability( just like me ) then go for it.Better then Samsung or Sony ??? Definitely no!!.,I always buy and recommend Samsung Sony or LG for TV. But, I had a hard budget this time and chose Vu because my friends have been using it for at least 4-5 years without much issues.While the delivery and installation were excellent, and TV on the whole is a decent package which gives good clarity than the rival Chinese TVs and Sound, smart features are poor here.You can connect Bluetooth headphones but no option to disconnect them. I had to pair and unpair everytime.There is no voice command button on remote. Even while using the screen button for voice input, nothing gets recognised. My 3k Fire stick voice recognition was tooo good.,I purchased VU gloled 55 inches TV after suggestion from my techie friends and online study. Technician from amazon came to my home for installation in drunken mode. But I compromised with him due to busy schedule of work. He installed tv with his small screws instead of VU standard wall screws. He did whatever he want. Proper installation was not performed.I just calm down then later i gave a complaint to amazon and VU Customer services. Amazon was not properly responded till now. But from VU side i got a huge response of problem solving. Min 3 to 4 customercare executives spoke with me, finally VU's vice President mr prashanth phoned me and apologized me for inconvenience happened to me. He told drunken technician is not from VU. I feel good for VU's Top level executives have interaction with me. From bottom to top level VUs Team in touch with me for a month to resolve my issue due to i stayed away from home. Before few days back technician came to my home again from vu. He reinstalled my tv in perfect position with dedication. I never expect this much customer friendly behaviour from VU Thank you very much VU. Kudos to VU Team...",

Its worth the purchase.,I recommend this product whoever needs a sturdy and fast charging also keep in mind your charger needs to support while using this cable,After seeing the reviews I ordered for this product for my Samsung S9 mobile. Although the cable is very steady and good it fails the main purpose. When I keep my mobile for charging the cable pin is very tight and I fear while putting and removing my mobile charging chip would break as it is very tight. I am looking for another alternative.So if you are looking for a charger for S9 Samsung mobile PLEASE FO NOT BUY IT.,Good,Superb,I have oneplus 6 mobile phone and have dash charger and oneplus cable which becomes a fast charging combo.However when i plugged in this cable with dash charger. It was not rapidly charging my phone. So I can't say if this is fast charging cable ot not.But as a common charging cable this is working perfectly fine,This is one of the best cable for fast charging. I have 3 units of 2 meter c type cable. I don't think it will get damage soon. The quality is very good and charging S22 ultra, Galaxy note 8 etc without any problem.

    "reviewContent": "Everything is great. I love this.,Very good and working very nice,First of all, thanks to Amazon for listing it as a returnable item and at an effective cost of less than 3k.Coming to the device itself, the reason for purchasing it is to experience Google TV. On that account, the interface is more useful than the standard Android TV one in terms of discovery, but the listed content is not that relevant.However, it is Realme that lets the user down. The device was bug ridden from the beginning and they basically abandoned the device in 6 months, with the last software update in Feb 2022, still riddled with bugs and never to see Google TV 12.The stick heats up enough to scald you if you touch it and it stutters like crazy after usage of over a day, in part due to the lackluster A35 ARM cores which is lacking in performance compared to A53 cores present in sticks from over 7 years ago, and also due to poor RAM management.Only reason to get it would be for the price, if it is less than 3k, but be prepared to suffer through a laggy interface and the known issues of the remote failing within a few months. Still males more sense to get a Fire TV stick which is more refined and receives more updates, although the interface is a love or hate it one.For the Google TV experience, it is better to go with Google TV with Chrome cast but that costs a bomb in India, for what it offers.,Got ( used ) product.It was trapped and also proformance is twice degrade to fire stick also not sucking wifi well as computer to Fire Stick",

    "reviewContent": "About the TV - Wonderful---------------------------------------------------------------Probably the best TV in this price range (INR13000).Good - Google interface, loaded with features, lightweight, 55 watt power consumption, stable designAverage - Sound and Picture quality is quite good but if you compare it with premium brands then obviously not that good.Features- Most of the streaming apps available and compatible- You can connect with WiFi, LAN Cable, HDMI, Set top box, Laptop, USB, Gaming console, Old dish cable, and direct TV antenna as well- Built in chromecast to cast any compatible app directly from phone to TV over same WiFi networkWays to connect phone -1. Via cast feature on mobile apps - no password needed only need to be on the same WiFi network2. Via chromecast app - project only selected media (pics, videos) or entire phone screenWays to connect PC/Laptop -1. Windows cast option - project the entire laptop screen on TV using windows cast option ( need to be connected on same WiFi network2. Via HDMI cableAbout the Amazon installation service - Awful-------------------------------------------------------1. The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It's awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can't use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It's running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it's good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(‚Çπ11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money. Good product,Very nice productSave money",

    "review": "Good,Does the job. Works with two devices,Positive review- Almost good and useful,Hissing sound  output from (viSe TV) Vijay sales.,Acceptable sound, no hassle of charging,Excellent product,Not good range,Very good",
    "reviewContent": "Atlast  I connected successfully. Working good. But sound volume & clarity not adequate. Durability, to be assessed.  Dear amazon.in, tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearly.Manual printing also is bad. I had to struggle.,Does what it says. Works well to connect two Bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop, smart TV, etc. Can take a bit of time to pair two devices. But the manual in the box helps.Sound quality over aux cable too is good. So, even if you do not have a digital output or RCA you can still use it. Bit bit flimsy and delicate. But then you don't need to move it around everyday.,Disadvantage - the sound and video lag with distance while connecting Bluetooth with headphones.Pairing with headphones difficult (need to wait long)Feels volumes low.,,I got this to add-on to a high-end system, which traditionally doesn't have the facility. However it's often requested when guests come over. I was using a Phoenix transreceiver, but the constant need of charging and the single indicator LED made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application. The optical out is connected to a dual ESS9028 DAC, and the device used for transmission is the iPad Air.This lacks a battery, which is a big differentiator. This means it is not exactly portable, and the form factor reinforces that 'feature'. It is intended to be a desktop unit, and it comes with a reasonable set of cables. The quality of the included cables is quite poor, so it's best to use something else.Compared to the direct input from USB, the overall sound is poorer, with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble. Still, this is being used in a high-end system - I suspect with many lesser speaker/amp/DACs it will be acceptable. At maximum output, the level is about 1-2dB lower than a direct USB connection to the DAC.It is around the same as my Signature Acoustics unit, which is 1/3rd the size but uses a battery, and doesn't have a volume control or the bypass feature, or the nice display which is handy if you are close by.The bypass is one of the highlights of this device, it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough, and allows you to use both BT and another optical source/receiver - though only either can be used at a time.The build quality is average. It is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards, hence the thin cables supplied. The onboard volume control is nice, if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume (I use the DAC remote). It also has only 16 clicks, so the control will be very coarse. The display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low, it is sufficient for the tasks.Overall, it's quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices. The sound quality limitations of BT transmission (compulsory resampling and lossy compression, among others) cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols, so I'd rank it close to the top of what you can get as an add-on for a hifi system. For more 'normal' usage, there are cheaper options available.,Excellent product,Bluetooth range is very less,Bought it to connect my old Sony 5.1 blueray home theater with MI 4k box which does not have Optical sound port. It has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in",

    "reviewContent": "Tv working good, the screen is VA type, if we want to see good picture we need to maintain minimum distance to tv because this tv pixels are so big. But if we maintain minimum distance picture looks so sharp and black levels look great. And other thing TV's colour reproduction is not that great compared to IPS screens. But in this price it is a good deal. Thare is definitely lag in tv software and remote control.  In the start i have bluetooth connection issue but after formatting tv problem was solved. This tv have sound bar and it's sounds great compared to other tv brands especially in this price range. I will recommend this tv if you want to buy this 32 inch S series tv.,Writing  review after 1.5 month use overall good but it become little slow when we install apps rest everything is fine. I liked it and i think you also love it if your budget is in this range.,First fall I was take as buy a acer tv, then I have fear because acer tv is new brand and if any problem with tv serving. But after purchased and  using my fear was goes. Because tv functions is good. And warranty also available.,Overall its a  good product, some times it lags and once it got auto restarted.but company has lied to customers with that there is 16 gb of space in the TV which is not therestill i like the picture and sound quality,I am very happy when I order this tv. I have purchased it on Diwali. When we start to use this tv, we found that to use the cromecast feature I need to install a third party app which is not support to my mobile phone (samsung M21). I am very disappointed now  for this feature but what can i do now. It has good and loud sound system. My overall experience is not meet to my expectations.,I regret not having gotten a larger size. This is an amazing smart tv, clear view and awesome sound. 4 stars only because I couldnt get jio universal remote to work with it.,Under 15k best smart Android TV everything is perfect  like sound, picture quality, Bluetooth connectivity and wifi. Connectivity,Finally a budget friendly smart TV  for middle class people who is having 30k salary per month. Picture quality- Ok Ok,  Sound- super, warnty- best, remote - simple over all nice one. No product is perfect in all segments, this one also not an exception.",

    "review": "Best(Branded) Budget TV,A high-quality 4k Smart TV from Samsung,Received Defective,Got Replacement,Nice product but,Tv is good,Best budget tv,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product",
    "reviewContent": "Before finalizing the AUE60 55\", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55\" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I'll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV's speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a VA panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I'd say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung's SmartThings App, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV's design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I'd say I'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. It's a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I'd highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. I don't require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. It also lacks base.Purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,But the picture quality is ok-ok.,Best tv product in given price range,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product",

But, the product is cheap Chinese plastic crap and definitely not a worth more than rs. 500 at most.  In the end, it's a cheap Chinese product sold in India at rs. 2600+ which is not even worth of more than rs. 500.

    "review": "Nice tv,Good product,Average,No operation button in television which is big irritate when the remote not working,Facing Sound/Audio Problem after 12 days of installation only - Please don't buy it,The after service is very good!,Good,........",
    "reviewContent": "Good quality,Good product,Average,No operation button in television which is big irritate when the remote not working,In simple words, Please don‚Äôt buy this MI TV and especially from Amazon/this seller (Sold by Cloudtail India and Fulfilled by Amazon).If you have patience and able to understand normal English(I don‚Äôt have writing skills to share exactly my feelings/pain) then please go through my following experience/feedback to know why I said Don‚Äôt buy it.Don‚Äôt wanna give single star but not allowing this site to post without starReason to Buy: Trust AmazonBy looking at the 4.3 out of 5 rating and #1 Best Seller tag I got interest on this TV. As we have trust on Amazon and also as it was coming in my budget with good features I purchased this MI 4A PRO TV.But, seems majority of good review/ratings are paid ones. These are cheating us, off course they didn‚Äôt force to buy, but being middle class person/human being we may get attract to things which showing better in less price. Seems this made/gave opportunity to these sellers to cheat us.Amazon Delivery Feedback: I may not comment on all deliveries happening not safely but when it came to me it‚Äôs not delivered safely.This TV came for home delivery in Troalley Auto without proper placement/safety, asked delivery person why alone kept it while coming due to up and downs of road it may fly right. He didn‚Äôt listen my words, simply said will take it back if any physical damage.He only open it and as outside nothing see damage, Delivery person said if any inner damage during installation time Technician came to know and will replace it and he forced me to tell OTP to accept me deliver and left.TV Installation Feedback: Did by Amazon Technician PersonInstead MI Technician, Amazon Technician came and installed this MI TV. I got it installed Stand mount as wall mount not freely providing.Technician somehow explained TV usage but thinking as not MI person not have full knowledge and exploring and telling each details.However, normal usage of TV, this amazon technician help is fine.TV Experience:First day: Having slight less picture quality and few showing pixels not as required for Eye safeness.After 3 or 4 days: Picture quality came better. Sound/Audio quality was good either on OTT/Youtbe or Setup box/DTHUp to 11 days: As we not used much and simply using it for watch DTH channels. Everything looks good.After 12 days: Amazon replacement time expired then started showing sound/Audio problem.TV sound coming very slow, When installed time/first 10 days, if we set up Volume 15 or 20 it was able give bigger sound, now though we increase volume 60 or 65 not giving the sound that we heard when it installed/setup (Played the same content which we listen in Youtube when after installation completed).Regarding this yesterday raised request, online service person asked me to update build version to latest, Now, it is PL.6036 but still have the same problem.2 or 3 days ago while watching suddenly TV got turned off, We did power off and on then it got switch on usually, also after sometime did screen mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked. But, not sure what problem, we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issues.Not sure, seems as I bought from this Amazon or MI service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problem.Online service person instead sending Technician to home for verifying problem. Told and did build version update with me to latest (Software update). Later, he said Volume limit got increased to 100 now, we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior. i.e. Before if 15/20 volume level gives big sound, then now 50/60 volume level the same sound. Asked, when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of Volume limit increase. But, he told OTT/some apps will show difference of this new feature, at the time as I have been on this calls and worries, got tired, I said will see and get back to you with new request.After some time, when I visited my friends/ better knowledge person on this problem came to know that he cheated me without solving problem, simply said some words to convey/tired us.Off course,  I can hear sound at 60 or 70 Volume but my concern is after purchase/installation of 13 days only I got this problem, in future how it works and how many further problems shows to me making me cruise.Being middle class person, we give value to single rupee also because we know how much efforts we put on to get that money. After purchase of this MI product crying lot why we went to it instead we could have went for further good brand product though they high in cost.Now, not replaced my TV or not did service by Technician. We decided that we got cheated on and prayed God to take care‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,Bought two years ago. My panel stopped displaying just one week before the warranty was to expire after two years. They promptly replaced it with a new one. I did not even spend one rupee extra.  Hassle-free. Highly recommend buying Mi products. The product is also awesome.,Good,Best product",

    "review": "Almost Perfect!,Review After using 1month,Nice tv,Panel and video quality,Good Product,Worth for money,Nice,Good",
    "reviewContent": "Update after 9 months of use:1. The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It's as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates, the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube, Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that's an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However, after using it for 2 months, the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now, up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes, I set brightness to 0, and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,a. it often gets disconnected from wifi - have to restart it againb. prime video fails to resume - displays error - and have to restart the TV againc. On the home screen, you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first. You can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first - easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itself.,Only Cons till now got, fast moving object looks blurr, which was known before buying by other user review, but i got this tv in 32 k,Ao over all satishfied,Only minus that too critical is the installation service provider.The product is to installed by v care installation services provider.The installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properly.Actual date of installation was on 21.02.22 but was only done by the service provider on 27.10.22.The executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and don't know how to behave to the customer.He behaved very rudely.The installation service provider is a total damage and waste. Not at all worth.,,Awesome quality of pictures and some issues with smart features like in app installation and in connection from smart phone only audio player in work properly but video not show in tv.,Dolby atom 4 k video etc,Good,Good",

    "review": "(after nearly one year use) Value for money TV, except for the sound,Spectacular Specification, Build Quality, and Performance",
    "reviewContent": ",What's not to love about this all-new 55 inch Amazon Fire TV?UNBOXINGThe whole experience from delivery to commissioning was completely seamless;  the packaging is strong and very sturdy, using a lot of bio-degradable materials; the unboxing was a delight, and fixing the (included) wall mount was a piece of cake.AMAZON INTEGRATIONNow comes the Amazon Magic!  Switch on the TV, and it already knew me, and my Amazon Prime Account.  After a brief online security check, all my content and apps automatically appeared on-screen, and setup was done!OPTICAL AUDIO OUTI'm using a JBL soundbar with sub-woofer which are connected to my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV using an optical cable (not supplied), and by simply changing settings on the TV my audio system automatically switches on and off with the TV, and the supplied TV Remote has volume controls for my cinema sound.  The sound reproduction is First Class.  I can't comment on the built-in TV Speakers, because I haven't used them.PICTURE QUALITYThere are lots of presets for the screen, including Natural, Cinema, Gaming, etc., and you can also set a customised screen to your own liking.  The picture quality is excellent, every bit as good as my other TV from a famous brand that costs 4X the price of my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV.  I'm impressed!HDMI & CONNECTIVITYI'm only using HDMI1 because all my content is streamed and I have been using an Amazon Firestick, and Google Chromecast.  The Chromecast is plugged into HDMI1, and the TV automatically switches to it when you want to use it.  However, I don't think I'll be using the Chromecast much, because Fire TV is so good, and has an amazing remote control.I'm also using a 2TB External hard drive plugged into the fast USB.  Playing movies, even in HD, is a perfect experience with no lag or juddering.Access to the sockets on the wall-mounted TV is OK if you have small arms, and although I'm only using HDMI1, Optical Audio Out and one USB, there is plenty of connectivity for other equipment.JUST ONE THING...This version of FireTV only allows Alexa to speak 2 languages, viz. English (Indian), or Hindi.My Amazon Firestick, Echo Show 8, Echo Show 5, Echo, and Echo Dot all have settings for English UK, Aus, USA, etc, Spanish, French, German, and many other languages.  I really would like to use Alexa on my 55 inch Amazon Fire TV in my native language - it makes it easier for Alexa to understand me, and easier for me to understand Alexa.I hope that this will come in a software update.CONCLUSIONI think that this 55 inch Amazon Fire TV is amazing, and I would recommend it without hesitation.",

    "reviewContent": "I liked it, worth the money, light weight and comfortable at every situation.this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn't fit them,don't worry.Even i thought it wouldn't fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,,In this watch, the screen does not turn on and off on double tap, for that you have to press the button and the battery also takes more than 1 hour instead of 35 minutes to get fully charged.  And the battery also lasts only 3-4 days, just hope that in the future, if I update the software, then the double tap option will come.,Watch is user friendly, UI is great.Calling feature is great.This watch is different from others in music playing in watch speaker.Great experience.Watchfaces option is good.We can add watchfaces as we can.In my other watch this feature is missing.Love this watch.,This Smartwatch is perfect for beginners who's buy first time smartwatch. ninja call pro plus is recently launched so it comes with latest features and specifications. Display Is top Notched and and brightness is enough for use at outdoor. Heart measure and Spo2 is well accurate all sensors are efficiently worked. Reading of data is accurate near 90 to 95% you can trust on it at emergency situations. It comes with 100 sports mods all types of activities and sports are coverd. Calling experience is also very nice, speaker and microphone is quite decent sufficient voice at indoor. But battery should be better it has require charge 1 time in day. 3D curved display give awasome visual experience. Strap quality is very soft and female also use it very smoothly. So overall it has best smartwatch under 2K Display, Calling, Sensors, Bulit quality, Battery Back-up, sports Mods, Waterproof, etc. You should definitely go for this one. Satisfied Product.üëçüî•üëç,This watch is very good but 1 problem im using this watch from 1 week and a few days back its pixels were droping, the screen was not working properly but after restarting, it was working properly and from then i didn,t face that problem again.,Nice watch with good UI interface with calling feature. Power packed with features in very low price. If you are on tight budget and looking for caling smartwatch you should definitely go for this one.,The build quality is great.The review about this watches are as follows:Good call quality and Google assistant supportThe UI experience is very smooth except the split screen feature it's a little bit laggyThe only thing that is only bad about this product is the step accuracy I feel like its a little bit lagging back but it catches up to it after a half an hourYou can buy this product if you are on a tight budget and want calling and good UI experience you can buy this product",

    "reviewContent": "2 months review- its been working fine, there's been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn't basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)Its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, I believe it could've been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, I'll give it 9/10, it's good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven't understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, I just believe what it says as i can't check prove if that's correct.the water resistance, I haven't used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch üòó,I've used this product for 4 days, and i'm going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -So, Bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don't get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. Only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super üëç. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look",

    "reviewContent": "[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It's good value for money smart watch.Light weight. Touch is smooth.All the features are 90-95% accurate.,a good product in this price range must buy itGOOD LOOKINGGOOD QUALITY,Good product is mst h,Average for calling good looking,I'm really happy to purchase this watch! It's very affordable having so many features. The calling feature works really well!

Must be about 1-1.5kg.Very quick charge. Takes ages (almost 8-10hrs) to fully charge. Charged my Samsung m53 twice once full charged.,I recently purchased the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and have been extremely impressed with its performance. I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others. It is a reliable and high-quality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity.",

    "reviewContent": "Touch screen functions well .step counting is not that much accurate, heart beat sensor is quite accurate but i think spo2 and stress measurement are not that much accurate,The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.Sleep tracking is decent.Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is goodAlso, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?,What i need in watch is not available so don't need this...can get it in normal watch from other brands,Look and feel is awesome. This is great product suggestions from Amazon. Thanks,I like the step count and heart rate accuracy. Not sure about stress count sometimes it shows inaccurate.,Bluetooth connectivity needs to be improve and touch also,All ok, but anti scratch glass required in this watch,Good watch go for it",

    "reviewContent": "Phone is ok except middle button it‚Äôs a headache.  rest all is good battery lyf is about 10-12 hrs when fully charged,Superb battery life for more then 3 days,I bought this phone to use as a replacement of my smartphone for calling, alarm, listening songs purposes.I didn't face any problem but the sound & its quality is somewhat low compared to normal smartphones. Song quality is not that good & not even bad but ok when listening through earphones.I only use it for receiving sms & calls & occassionally to listen songs & battery backup is very good that it lasts upto 7 days etc.. for 1 full charge.It would've been much better, if it included more alarm options than the limited 5 alarms, stopwatch & timer.Overall, it's a good replacement of smartphone for me till now.,Action button(center button) is not good, it takes more than 1 attempt sometimes to perform OK action.,Battery backup bad,Needs to improve ringtone sound,best phone hai. nokia is always best. price thodi kam karni chahiye.,I like this product",

Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge.,üî• Heating issues during use with in 15 minutes uses.Touch screen üì± issues some times it's too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing.We all family are using samsung mobiles but this time I worried of issues if I have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data it's very irritating work I wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through Amazon.üî• 15 ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§®‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¶‡•å‡§∞‡§æ‡§® ‡§π‡•Ä‡§ü‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡•§‡§ü‡§ö ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§® üì± ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä-‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§¨‡§¢‡§º‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä-‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§™ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§Ø ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§™‡•à‡§° ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§à ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§™‡§°‡§º‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§‡§π‡§Æ ‡§∏‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§¨‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§â‡§™‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§π‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡§ø‡§® ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ö‡§ø‡§Ç‡§§‡§ø‡§§ ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§™‡§°‡§º‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§Æ‡•ã‡§¨‡§æ‡§á‡§≤ ‡§¨‡§¶‡§≤‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§°‡•á‡§ü‡§æ ‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡§´‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§™‡§∞‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§∏‡•à‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§™‡§¢‡§º ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§§‡•ã ‡§ï‡•É‡§™‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•á‡§ú‡§º‡•Ö‡§® ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∞ ‡§¶‡•á‡§Ç .,Bought for mom as she just want to use for calls.

Charged my Samsung m53 twice once full charged.,I recently purchased the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and have been extremely impressed with its performance. I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others. It is a reliable and high-quality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity.",

I am not sure it came out due to hot glass. But never faced that again. Also, mostly I use this mount with arms extended to it maximum length. arms are stable during the vibration of car due to bad roads.

    "review": "THE PERFECT PHONE ‚Äì FOR MY REQUIREMENTS,Galaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability",
    "reviewContent": "I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them ‚Äì or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes ‚Äì but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement ‚Äì which is entirely non-negotiable ‚Äì is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf ‚Äì primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‚Äòimmersive listening experience‚Äô and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers ‚Äì because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging).

    "reviewContent": "I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good",

    "reviewContent": "I liked it, worth the money, light weight and comfortable at every situation.this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn't fit them,don't worry.Even i thought it wouldn't fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,,In this watch, the screen does not turn on and off on double tap, for that you have to press the button and the battery also takes more than 1 hour instead of 35 minutes to get fully charged.  And the battery also lasts only 3-4 days, just hope that in the future, if I update the software, then the double tap option will come.,Watch is user friendly, UI is great.Calling feature is great.This watch is different from others in music playing in watch speaker.Great experience.Watchfaces option is good.We can add watchfaces as we can.In my other watch this feature is missing.Love this watch.,This Smartwatch is perfect for beginners who's buy first time smartwatch. ninja call pro plus is recently launched so it comes with latest features and specifications.

Reading of data is accurate near 90 to 95% you can trust on it at emergency situations. It comes with 100 sports mods all types of activities and sports are coverd. Calling experience is also very nice, speaker and microphone is quite decent sufficient voice at indoor. But battery should be better it has require charge 1 time in day. 3D curved display give awasome visual experience. Strap quality is very soft and female also use it very smoothly. So overall it has best smartwatch under 2K Display, Calling, Sensors, Bulit quality, Battery Back-up, sports Mods, Waterproof, etc. You should definitely go for this one. Satisfied Product.üëçüî•üëç,This watch is very good but 1 problem im using this watch from 1 week and a few days back its pixels were droping, the screen was not working properly but after restarting, it was working properly and from then i didn,t face that problem again.,Nice watch with good UI interface with calling feature. Power packed with features in very low price. If you are on tight budget and looking for caling smartwatch you should definitely go for this one.,The build quality is great.The review about this watches are as follows:Good call quality and Google assistant supportThe UI experience is very smooth except the split screen feature it's a little bit laggyThe only thing that is only bad about this product is the step accuracy I feel like its a little bit lagging back but it catches up to it after a half an hourYou can buy this product if you are on a tight budget and want calling and good UI experience you can buy this product",

    "review": "THE PERFECT PHONE ‚Äì FOR MY REQUIREMENTS,Galaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability",
    "reviewContent": "I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them ‚Äì or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes ‚Äì but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement ‚Äì which is entirely non-negotiable ‚Äì is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf ‚Äì primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‚Äòimmersive listening experience‚Äô and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers ‚Äì because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone ‚Äì but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung‚Äôs best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros¬†Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading¬† of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a¬†screen recorder,¬†video call effects, Game Launcher,¬†Link to Windows,¬†Dual Messenger,¬†Quick Share,¬†Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others.

    "review": "Nice watch but some cons,Great device for the budget !! And amazing amazon service!!,Good watch in this price,Watch faces could have been better,Amoled Screen & Touch, Average Wrist Band.",
    "reviewContent": "Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watchPros# Amoled Display is very bright and nice# Look and design is premium# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch üòÇStrap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,I write this review after 1 week of using this watch, BP, BPM, SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it's a good watch.,Everything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatch.But these things could have been better:. Watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. App ui could have been better. DND mode absent. No option to toggle Bluetooth (always on),Before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.I loved the Touch Screen experience & Amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. The band of the watch is average & doesn't look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I don't find it good enough if I compare it with Boat's App for its watches (As I own a Boat smartwatch). Rest Visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band.",

Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6.

    "reviewContent": "I liked it, worth the money, light weight and comfortable at every situation.this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn't fit them,don't worry.Even i thought it wouldn't fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,,In this watch, the screen does not turn on and off on double tap, for that you have to press the button and the battery also takes more than 1 hour instead of 35 minutes to get fully charged.  And the battery also lasts only 3-4 days, just hope that in the future, if I update the software, then the double tap option will come.,Watch is user friendly, UI is great.Calling feature is great.This watch is different from others in music playing in watch speaker.Great experience.Watchfaces option is good.We can add watchfaces as we can.In my other watch this feature is missing.Love this watch.,This Smartwatch is perfect for beginners who's buy first time smartwatch. ninja call pro plus is recently launched so it comes with latest features and specifications. Display Is top Notched and and brightness is enough for use at outdoor. Heart measure and Spo2 is well accurate all sensors are efficiently worked. Reading of data is accurate near 90 to 95% you can trust on it at emergency situations. It comes with 100 sports mods all types of activities and sports are coverd. Calling experience is also very nice, speaker and microphone is quite decent sufficient voice at indoor. But battery should be better it has require charge 1 time in day. 3D curved display give awasome visual experience. Strap quality is very soft and female also use it very smoothly. So overall it has best smartwatch under 2K Display, Calling, Sensors, Bulit quality, Battery Back-up, sports Mods, Waterproof, etc. You should definitely go for this one. Satisfied Product.üëçüî•üëç,This watch is very good but 1 problem im using this watch from 1 week and a few days back its pixels were droping, the screen was not working properly but after restarting, it was working properly and from then i didn,t face that problem again.,Nice watch with good UI interface with calling feature. Power packed with features in very low price. If you are on tight budget and looking for caling smartwatch you should definitely go for this one.,The build quality is great.The review about this watches are as follows:Good call quality and Google assistant supportThe UI experience is very smooth except the split screen feature it's a little bit laggyThe only thing that is only bad about this product is the step accuracy I feel like its a little bit lagging back but it catches up to it after a half an hourYou can buy this product if you are on a tight budget and want calling and good UI experience you can buy this product",

    "reviewContent": "After using the phone for a day, I feel corners have been cut in various areas:JN1 sensor is not that great in low light. Color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens. Interesting to note that JN1 is also being used in Samsung's new F23.Thermal management is very poor. Device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high. Same is the case when camera app is opened/simple games on flipkart gamezone are played. There are reports on youtube of narzo50's camera shutting down on hot days.Above scenarios and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazy.Speaker and earpiece do not have crispiness (upper treble), instead sound like white noise. Earpiece volume is low. So is the speaker volume when on call. On the other hand, speaker volume is decent while playing back videos.Flashlight is half as bright as normal smartphones. I don't really know if company did cost cutting here, or its a software bug.No fm radio and secondary mic.Minor features I missed if shifting from miui to realmeui - e.g. the gallery app is not as good as miui one, requiring more taps for basic opeeations like viewing whatsapp images folder.Mediocre ram management with realmeui 2, android 11.To be fair, I could not find any major bug in realmeui 2.0 so far. The lcd display is fantastic, and very well calibrated with relatively cooler white point, as opposed to yellowish 5500-6500k super amoled. There was no green or purple tint. Touch response was excellent. Screen protector, case, fast charger, usb c cable were present. The phone feels much slimmer than my bulky F22 due to its thin body, 10gm less weight and sleek case. Camera app has full fledged manual mode, something absent from Samsung's F22.Disclaimer: Above impression has been made after using 4 smartphones over last 8 years: Asus Zenfone 5, Redmi 4, Redmi 7A, Samsung F22.Strongly consider other current alternatives too, like Redmi note 11, Poco m4 pro, Poco m4 pro 5g, Redmi note 10t 5g,  Samsung F22, Samsung F23, Moto G42 before buying Narzo 50.More info: Do not fall for bloatwares like glance when setting up the phone. Check as few check boxes as possible before blindly clicking 'I agree'. Turn off content recommendation by going to the Settings -> Additional Settings -> Get Recommendations and switch the green toggle off. To remove bloatwares that cannot be uninstalled usual way, follow excellent guide by youtuber 'tech office' mentioning all realme app names required for adb commands. I was able to uninstall hot apps/games this way.UPDATE:Detailed camera comparison between Samsung F22 and Narzo 50:Samsung's HDR algo seems more sophisticated, narzo unnaturally brightens some shadows too much, there is also some oversharpening.Both cameras choose cool auto white balance, which results in bluer skies but lifeless greeneries even in 'golden hours'. However, narzos colors become more 'hue accurate' after choosing 6000-6500k white point in 'expert mode', whereas samsung still delivers bluish green foliage colors at cloudy white balance. Narzo strangely does some weak auto hdr even in 'expert mode', but samsung fully turns it off in 'pro mode', resulting unusable photos.However, when using night mode, narzo's photos appear more cleaner but less saturated at night.  Gcam 8.5 for narzo is not optimized properly and gives noisy night photos with greenish cast and crushed shadows, much worse than realme's night mode. On the other hand, thereas no gcam and no camera2api support for F22. At night, you can take long exposure shots (upto 8/16/32secs) through 'expert mode' by manually choosing shutter speed in narzo, something you can't do in F22. This however requires tripod support and whenever done properly, the results are very good.You have manual 'film' mode in narzo, whereas you can't even manually set white balance in F22's video mode, as samsung's lower end galaxys don't have 'pro video' mode.,This mobile is suitable for every oneIt's goodBut camara is average,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719puSga96L._SY88.jpg,Good quality,Very good phone .Iam very happy with this while using.thank you Amaon.,I had purchased this phone in 10k and this phone is actually brilliant in this price range, Camera is good, fingerprint sensor is good, back panel is good (i purchased black one) , no hang but there is a small problem that battery drains little faster and when you click Home button, google assistant appears most of the time which is quite annoying sometimes, overall i am happy with the phone .,I wanted an affordable phone ; this fits the bill perfectly.,Fantastic finger reader, battery sustainability for a long time usage, and HD Quality natural photographs. Awesome product at stunning a price.",

    "reviewContent": "I bought this product with the hope that it would be a good and stable selfie stick. But it didn‚Äôt help at all. .It is not suitable for large phones like IPhone 11 Pro Max . . Very clumsy and the tripod doesn‚Äôt stand at all. . Keeps sliding. .Had a very difficult time to set up the selfie stick. .,Pros :1. Useful stick - stable only till half length, after that it shakes like crap2. Bluetooth Remote is given which is very very useful (infact necessary i would say)Cons :1.Useful only till half opened - after that it shakes like anything.2.Lacks a mount to mount any led flashlight for low light videos.3. BIGGEST CON : cost of 2 batteries is more than the selfie stick itself. Now as i have no money for going for a gimble , so i am using this as well as bought 2 spare batteries (costed me 500 rupees for 2 batteries). Although i must say that you can find the CR1632 - 3v battery (the one used in this one) - much cheaper than what i paid on either local ecom website or local shops.,one must have this tripod to get full family picturethe quality is upto the markand it is standing strongly with weight of phonebluetooth control is quick and clear,If you are taking photos with your family at home then it is good. But if you are a single rider and ride solo then its length is normal. You will get only half of your photo. It should be of such length that the rider can take a complete picture with his riding gears.Then it is good for the riders. My suggestion is that it should be more length.,Everything is perfect except if you pull the tripod to a long hight,Superb,Good at all.,I haven't used it much, product is good. Its neat and clean, remote works well. the part where phone keeps thats too hard to open and it needs to be more sturdy.",

    "reviewContent": "2 months review- its been working fine, there's been no problem as of now.. some things-the whole step tracking thing, i bought it due to that reason, it didn't basically satisfy me to that level with that, but it does count steps accurately in the walking mode(activity)Its got some scratches in it.. but its not that noticeable at first glancethe backgrounds, I believe it could've been wayyyy better if we could change 4-5 backgrounds of 10, but we can only have 2, 1 customised and 1 download from the app(which has limited options)  the other backgrounds are just.. eh..the looks, I'll give it 9/10, it's good looking stylish differenttouch screen is goodthe sleep tracking too is kinda accurate(i still haven't understood it that well lol)battery life is muah, I use it without Bluetooth and it easily survives for 6-7 daysspo2 and heart rate, I just believe what it says as i can't check prove if that's correct.the water resistance, I haven't used it in water (ofc am scared) the calling feature works fine.. its got good sound overall its a decent watch and can be used in day to day activities, am quite satisfied with it as my first smart watch üòó,I've used this product for 4 days, and i'm going to rate the various features and different aspects of this smartwatch which could help the customers here -So, Bluetooth calling (4/5) - the in-built mic of this watch is excellent and the voice gets to the other side without any disturbance, watch connects smoothly with the mobile and don't get disconnected automatically until you do it yourself through watch or phone. Only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super üëç. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look",

    "review": "Solid phone, worth considering,Good Phone,Overall decent product,Apart from the camera everything is fine,Product is good,Honest Review after 14 days usage,Superb but need improvement in camera,Best camera",
    "reviewContent": "I bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several YouTube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones. My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch. Within 1 month it dropped by 3k.The price qty is ok.Some features are missing which are available in Chinese make model.,Pros1. Display(super amoled)2. Battery life(24 hrs moderate usage)3. Fast charging4. 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1. Miui(lots of unnecessary apps)2.processor(sd 695 is too old)3.main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if you're looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for it.(pubg, cod feels fantastic in this without any lag)If looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brother.,Good phone need improvement in camera,This mobile has the best camera compared with other models",

    "reviewContent": "[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It's good value for money smart watch.Light weight. Touch is smooth.All the features are 90-95% accurate.,a good product in this price range must buy itGOOD LOOKINGGOOD QUALITY,Good product is mst h,Average for calling good looking,I'm really happy to purchase this watch! It's very affordable having so many features. The calling feature works really well! Overall, if you're looking so good brand & good features, go for this ..,Product does not turn onPlease return the item. Please.",

    "review": "Let's bust some myth,IQOO Neo 6 5G ‚Äì A midrange model that offers virtually everything I want",
    "reviewContent": "I ordered this phone based on specs it was providing, later I saw flood of negative reviews coming up on Amazon which made me test few of things that was mentioned, if it was true.1. Calls getting disconnected - I had call with my brother last night and we talked for 50 min and call did not disconnect in the middle.2. Heating issue - While in day to day use never faced heating issue but It gets a little hot while charging, I can understand because of massive fast charging which is understandable. Every phone with fast charging heats a little.3. Camera Quality - It has a decent 64 mp Samsung camera module which is justified at price it comes. You can judge the camera based on how well it performs indoor with artificial lighting conditions and this has done good. Attached pic of cake which I clicked indoor only bright light source was candle. It performed well I can say.(To people who complaint about camera -  I just cannot expect picture clarity of Apple or Samsung high end devices, i have to set my expectations right for the price we have paid)4. AnTuTu Benchmark Score - While company claim of 740000+ while I tested i got a score of 700000+ . I again cannot complaint here because I don't know what was the testing conditions and criteria that company had followed while testing. 700000+ is pretty decent score I can say5. Phone lag - In two days of testing it has not lagged at all. With multiple background apps running.6. Battery Drain - Revisit few of the settings on your device, like animation, transition effect etc to get most out of your battery. If your batter is set of monstor mode set it to normal or battery saver to make most. Again battery depends of usage of individual and i cannot blame company. While I started to write this review my cell phone was at 100%. Now it's almost 25 min typing till now it's now showing 99%, i have set my screen at full brightness, i fell its decent. Also tested charging speed 0 to 50 in 12.03 min.7. Build quality - It's sturdy and decent plastic is used. I can say at this price point they should have provided glass build but again considering all price benefit you have got while buying this phone no complaint (Card Discount + Exchange Benefit etc) . Still I would take out 1 star here.8. Black colour issue - Did not face any problem with screen leak or black colour. It's AMOLED screen. Black is highlight of AMOLED. In case you were using IPS / FHD panel on your previous phone you will have trouble distinguishing. I have Samsung M51 as secondary device and i see black similar on both.9. BGMI - I played few rounds yesterday and did not face any frame drop or lag.10. Two year warranty - They calaimed to provide two year warranty on this device but during registration it shows only 1 year. I have personally wrote to Iqoo team and Amazon team seeking an answer, with screenshots waiting for answer.BTW majority of phone manufacturers provide 1 year warranty only, even iPhone. Here I would say fight for you justice and seek answer from Iqoo or Amazon Team.11. Video call lag - Did not face any, did multiple video calls yesterday with different people, did not get any complaint from them about my video lag. For all of them my video popped up instantaneous.Overall I would say I had a great buy and can recommend this device to others , for all the folks bombarding negative reviews, I would say first set your expectations right and you will be satisfied. In case even still you are facing problem then you have every right to complaint and get justice.Overall i give this device a 4 star as of now since I am yet to test this device long term like 3 months or 4 months.*Please excuse any typos or grammatical errors if any. Entire review was typed on my phone Iqoo Neo 6.,I have been using a budget phone realme 3 since 2019 (dynamic black, 3GB/64GB). It served me well, but it was time for an upgrade. I was looking for a midrange model this time that would have almost everything I wanted within my budget. Did I get one? Let‚Äôs dig into it!THE GOOD# Price. After discounts, I got a phone with practically all the features I wanted.# IQOO is basically from Vivo, an internationally recognized brand. Hopefully, I don‚Äôt have to worry about software updates for at least 3 years. IQOO is already doing good as I have received 3 security updates so far for the Android 12 that came out of the box. I will keep an eye on the security updates and OS upgrades as it will make me decide whether to go for Vivo/IQOO for my next phone.# Dual 5G SIM support, which is futuristic. With 4G, the call quality has been superb so far.# E4 AMOLED 120 Hz 1300 nits (peak) 1080x2400 pixels display with 6000000:1 contrast ratio, 360 Hz touch sampling rate and HDR10+ (Netflix HDR supported). A huge upgrade from my previous phone. The photos, OTT movies look too good. Easier to read contents like messages, emails or documents.# 64 MP main cam with OIS. OIS was a must-have feature for me since I could be taking a lot of low-light photos.# 4700 mAh battery with 80W FlashCharge Technology; 50% in 12 min, 100% in 32 min. Works as claimed. The battery life has been satisfactory.# SD 870 CPU. Not one of the flagship processors today, but highly capable, and fantastic at this price. Inclusion of 12 GB RAM has made this phone a buttery-smooth one for running apps (Android is quite a RAM dependent OS unlike iOS). Up to 4 GB of phone storage can be used for extended RAM. Currently, I have 100+ apps installed (mostly productivity apps, but no gaming apps). The cascade cooling system seems to be working.# 256 GB ROM with UFS 3.1. Since phones nowadays tend to ditch a dedicated microSDXC slot, and this phone is no exception, I did not want the 128 GB variant. A fast, large internal ROM is better than an external card as the latter loads the apps, files slower.# The in-display fingerprint reader works well.# The stereo speakers are reasonably good.# Infrared port (IR blaster). I have not tried using it as a remote, but a must try.# USB-C port with USB-C to USB-A data cable that connects to the phone charger. Some of us prefer a USB-C to USB-C data cable instead as it is more friendly to the modern devices, but I can see why IQOO decided to provide a USB-C to USB-A. Most laptops still come with USB-A ports (even my recent hp 250 G8 laptop from the company I work for does have a USB-C port without power delivery, and two USB-A ports!). My powerbanks don‚Äôt have USB-C ports either.# Screenshots, lock screen virtual buttons. Must as using physical buttons frequently for these functions can potentially damage the buttons.THE BAD# Google backup. A FAIL. Since I did not have a USB-C to USB-C cable, I had to choose the Wi-Fi data transfer option from my old phone to this one. Although I selected all the files, Google failed to transfer many files especially the PDFs. Dear Google, this is unacceptable.# Spam handling. My realme 3 lets me block any SMS I want, but this one does not. In my opinion, every modern phone must have a native app that can identify the caller and help block a number or an SMS as needed. I have stopped using a 3rd party app like Truecaller, which has become a truly rogue app.# No 3.5 mm jack (a plus when you don't have a bluetooth earphone, or don't prefer one), but IQOO thankfully included a USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter in the box.# The absence of gorilla glass protection is not a good thing, but I do not mind as I barely drop my phone, and the phone came with an already applied tempered glass screen protector, and a transparent back cover. Really appreciated. The plastic body does not bother me; moreover, the dark nova color feels cool. YMMV.# In my realme 3 (and not in my realme C2, which means it is a custom feature from realme for specific OS versions), if I try turning off the daily wakeup alarm, it gives me options like ‚ÄúTurn off on‚Ä¶‚Äù (the next day for which the alarm is active), ‚ÄúDo not repeat any more‚Äù, or ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù. This is a fabulous feature as it allows me to turn off the alarm for a particular day (say, an upcoming leave or holiday) without turning it off for the following days! Unfortunately, this artificial intelligence is not available in my IQOO Neo 6 5G.Always buy a recently released model if you are going for an Android phone. This will make sure that you get software support for long enough time. Moreover, avoid buying the variant with lowest RAM/ROM. And, fast charging is a necessity as you see that you are hooked up with your phone all the time.I have used this phone for ~ 2 months and will update this review as I keep using it. Till date, I am quite satisfied with IQOO Neo 6 5G (I also liked the Funtouch OS), and recommend it to anybody who has needs like me.",

    "reviewContent": "I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good",

    "review": "Little above average Earbuds,Buds i love,Unique form factor,Best call quality ear buds,Good but is it worth it,Bluetooth range not that good,Excellent sounding pair of earbuds with one fatal flaw,Bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark",
    "reviewContent": "The earphones have good clear sound quality. It lacks base. Battery backup is good. ANC is a myth in this earphone. It might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,Eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. Over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,Bought this solely due to its form factor - to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. To be true Samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique TWS.This is not an inear style TWS but resembles somewhat earbud style TWS, only of its kind in the market as far as my Knowledge goes.They are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out (strange as I can't use earbuds because they fall out frequently). It seems that Samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. However, it doesn't mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.The finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch.  The size of the buds and the case is very small.Now about the sound. If the buds fit in one's ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.The sound signature is very bassy for my taste and I have to eq it to my taste. The bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. I listen it in TREBLE BOOST mode adjusted through the app. ANC works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. In contrary, ANC ON somewhat opens up the sound. Don't buy this for ANC.Strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iPhone 12mini than my Galaxy S22 (Spotify and Apple Music). The buds have app support for both Android (Galaxy wear) and iOS (Galaxy Buds Live) but the Android app is more feature packed and works better.  The iOS app couldn't update the firmware (although there is a Menu in the app) and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. However,  as soon as I connected with my S22, on pairing,  the first thing it did was to update the firmware.I love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4K against an MRP of 16K. The do sound very good but does not suit my taste.  Persons loving bass may love them. Don't get them for ANC. Battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. It has wireless charging too. If your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,Best call quality. Noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.Descent battery life.Music is good. Not to that top notch, but good in this segment.Overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,I am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,Bluetooth range is not that good,The sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. I got these for Rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until I faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. The bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. It feels like I am using bluetooth v3.0. The range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. The mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. I think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone's quality. If you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. Samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. I pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. Even at Rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue. It is better to buy a wired IEM, atleast it will sound better than this.,In this price Samsung brand is goodEasy to wear and good battery backupHardly support the 2 meter Bluetooth connectivity",

    "reviewContent": "Verdict : A Solid buy for this price segment in 2022 (and even for early 2023)There are 2 reviews in this section. Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are \"un-installable\". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the \"Alert slider\" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in \"Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.üëç,Battery drains like any thing. Rest all good.I have to recharge twice a day, don't buy if you want a good battery backup.Even though phone is fast charge, I am disappointed with battery life.,I bought 12gb and 256 and it's working very smoothly, for normal regular use you can go for it.,There is problem with temper glass part , front Cemera area temper glass not installing,Good but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 it's ordinary like 8gb .,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.",

    "reviewContent": "So about the product Boom ultima, as it goes by the name it really got the ultimate bass effect. Wires are great built and tangle free. The audio jack is compatible with almost all devices and its gold plated as well. I just didn't find the case. It was missing from my product. Though they have given 2 pairs of extra buds with different sizes. Overall it's a great wired in mic earphones. Go ahead and add to your cart. You won't regret it.,So first, let's talk about the external-Bulid quality is awesome 9/10 even at such an affordable price.Looks-I have all 3 colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolWire-the wire quality is 9/10. I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. üòäAs you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that's awesome. But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÉEdited:-Their services are slower now. Don't know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1-9-21And I saw some trend with it. My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 months.It's not a problem though cause you can mail 'em regarding this. This happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphone.Still the best earphones, you can find at this price point,NOT FOR HIGH BASS LOVERS,Everything was OK but as shown in the picture that you will get a case along with earphones,which was not there inside it(only earphone and some earplucks were there),This range very good product.if your budget under- 400 definitely you can bye this product.,Nice product,Product is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the description in the second delivery also, despite the return of first delivery of the product  for REPLACEMENT with pouch,product is good but needs to work on noise cancellation",

    "reviewContent": "I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good",

    "reviewContent": "I am using OnePlus 10R 8GB 128GB more than one month. It is my first ever OnePlus phone. My personal review about this phone is as under:Pros:1. Boxy design looks nice but feels not so premium but if you use its cover it feels nice. Cover quality is very nice.2. Screen is bright even in sunlight if you select auto brightness. Also screen color and touch response feels premium.3. Battery life is very impressive with 1.5 day backup with normal use.4. 80 watt charger is very fast which charge your phone within 30 to 35 minutes.5. I am not a heavy gamer but I tried asfalt 9 which runs very smooth.I think it'll play heavy games smoothly. So it perform well.6. I am new to use Oxygen OS. I feels OS premium and smooth without adds.7. Rear camera shots very good pictures but selfie camera need some improvement which I think can be done via software update.8. No heating issue.9. Lightweight.Cons:1. If you use without case, it doesn't feel like premium phone.2. I don't like the sound quality although is has dual speaker. You can feel vibration on its back pannel which feels very bad.3. Selfie camera needs improvement.4. Zoom is very bad on rear camera.5. No IP certification.6. No expendable storage.7. Paid theme store.8. Should have some dot notch animations like samsung.  At last I can say it is a nice phone with some cons, if you want OnePlus smartphone within Rs. 35000/- you can go for it.,Terrific purchase at the price of 33k. Body I feel light htough it is not as usual OnePlus body as I had been the user of one plus in past also. Metallic sides could be a better option. Sometimes I feel lag in touch though it is for microseconds but it is there. Camera quality is good not awesome. Battery life is good i used to charge once and a day can be completed by itm Obviously, i bought it as it is one of the affordable option in terms of brand. Love to see metallic frames in coming phones. Storage is tremendous and speed is also good m Overall a good purchase a phone can be rated 4 out of 5.,This smart phone is good enough for daily normal use. But battery life is not good enough though is says 5000 mAh. Camera quality is not good enough in this price segment. Although it's Oxygen os, it is not well optimised. From the starting there will be some lagging issue with some apps. Another bad thing about this smart phone is its form factor. The company taking around 39k but giving just a plastic body which will looks like below 20k. If someone wants to buy this i suggest to buy another model don't go for this model because of the brand. One good thing is oneplus promised three major android update and four years security update. Another bad thing its primary camera design. One of the three camera is so big that it's embracing to say its price is 39k.,I would like to get directly to the pros and consPros.1) BATTERY - The first and the best thing about this phone is the damn battery life and how fast it charges. It's just amazing and I have been kind of spoilt by it now, I wont be able to adjust with a lesser battery performance and charging anymore!2.  CAMERA- The camera is amazing and takes some really amazing pictures. No complains.3. LOOKS - The phone looks really beautiful. I got the forest green colour and it looks simply awesome and is eye catching and premium looking.CONS1) The overall working of the phone is not as seamless as it should be provided the hardware it boasts of. Having said that, the factor cannot be a purchase deterrent. It's otherwise quite smooth2) The absence of an alert slider was a disappointed. I was used to it on my 6T3)Volume - Not too happy with the phone speakers. They somehow are not up to the mark.To sum it up- Just go for it if you have a tight budget but want a premium looking, good performing phone. It packs too much for a 43k phone - good battery, fastest charging in the segment, premium looks, good performance.,Using the phone after two days I have noticed weird experience with UI, tapping on grey or black areas screen flickers to that portion and according to service centre it's common issue across all phones and getting fixed by Oxygen 13 update as there were no issue with 10pro.So we have to do nothing but to wait for releasing the new OS update on the 10R and other models as well.Overall device working good so far I experienced average camera results,superb charging but not so extended battery life, touch sensor and speakers are fine and performance is good in my day to day tasks, hopefully UI and OS updates will help to deliver best of this phone.,Over all camera üì∏ is just ammazing I am a youtuber purpuse behind choosing this device is it's processer dimencity 8100max it's a supersaft max performence not even capturing while gaming also it's runs very smoothly and it's my FIRST PREMIUM SMARTPHONE I'm the uploded photos20x zoom lg pic and I have uploded night and day liting pics to compareGood device from one plus,Its speaker is not really working well using it since 6months only plus it dosent comes with a warrenty plan it has to be brought separate camera quality is also okay not thattt good microphone is also been disturbing a lot while talking on the call other side person gets a lot of disturbance",

    "review": "THE PERFECT PHONE ‚Äì FOR MY REQUIREMENTS,Galaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability",
    "reviewContent": "I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them ‚Äì or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes ‚Äì but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement ‚Äì which is entirely non-negotiable ‚Äì is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf ‚Äì primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‚Äòimmersive listening experience‚Äô and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers ‚Äì because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone ‚Äì but for my requirements. A word of advice: if you are planning to buy a new phone, it would be helpful if you list out your requirements so that you do not end up paying for features that you do not intend to use.,With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung‚Äôs best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros¬†Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading¬† of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a¬†screen recorder,¬†video call effects, Game Launcher,¬†Link to Windows,¬†Dual Messenger,¬†Quick Share,¬†Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others.

Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging. The speed of charging is alright and appropriate. The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the Power-Bank itself, without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy.,Bit heavy but does it‚Äôs job. Takes tooooooo much time to charge. Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging.,I needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity.

When i first received this power bank it came in a small box (approx 12x9x3cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) with everything forced in congested space. The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal & no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between. So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away.‚Üí This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch.2. When replacement came, it came in a poly-wrapped bigger box (22x10x4 cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal. Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging. The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening. Looked like it was applied with an open box. So its presence was useless.‚Üí This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üëú CARRY POUCH‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Üí As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box.‚Üí Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it. (Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit. Neither loose nor tight.‚Üí Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢üèÜ VERDICT‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚ñ∂ At the price point its not a bad deal. Its a midway path b/w low quality and high-quality ones. You can very well go for Ambrane, as it makes good quality & durable power banks. Rest, nothing is perfect in this world. For this thing only, 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1-year warranty from Ambrame is available.‚ñ∂ If one can extend the budget by a few hundred, MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body & better quality overall. I have MI, Honor & Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be (from low to high) Ambrane ‚Üí Honor ‚Üí MI,I am putting up this review after 1 day of usage. This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family. Before to this i have bought their PP-30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good, here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison. My dad uses Redmi note 7, my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you don't need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same- Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP-30- Solid and sturdy built- 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries, this i came to know while buying this product-  ‚Çπ200 cheaper price than MI- Touch button at the top to know the power status (this is something unique)-  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13% to 100% at 2 cell battery indicator, which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro- I don't know either it is pro or con, both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 2.4 Amp, but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself. I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dad's Redmi note 7 (which supports QC 4.0) either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP-30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone, also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life, so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 2.4 ampCons:-- Very stuffy packaging, it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box- It has some adhesive tape at the top i don't know why ? which, when you remove it, puts scratches on the top, be careful while removing the same- No torch light, their PP-30 have it- only micro cable inside the box,Definitely heavy but I knew this. I will recommend this, as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phones.,Nice product,Power backup is good.. but the USB cable provided is very bad. It stopped working after few months of usage,Everything is good but the battery don‚Äôt last that long when use for charging two device.",

    "reviewContent": "I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating.

    "reviewContent": "Review OverviewAverage2.7The Boat today launched the ‚Äò Boat Xtend ‚Äò, the company‚Äôs latest budget smartwatch with a price tag of Rs. 2,999. The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don‚Äôt like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don‚Äôt look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won‚Äôt notice the bezels, and the screen quality won‚Äôt feel cheap at all. It doesn‚Äôt have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn‚Äôt something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn‚Äôt much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won‚Äôt find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that‚Äôs why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won‚Äôt find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won‚Äôt prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won‚Äôt be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won‚Äôt be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven‚Äôt noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don‚Äôt find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn‚Äôt like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69\"), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.,üëç,Plz add calling feature with this,Otherwise it is ok,Good,It's little expensive but okkk,",

    "reviewContent": "[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It's good value for money smart watch.Light weight.

It's very affordable having so many features. The calling feature works really well!

    "review": "Excellent Phone in the budget segment,Best value for money... But afraid of future MIUI updates.,Don't purchase it as camera phone üò§,Dependable & it's been a year.,Budget mobile,Good for basic use,Phone is nice , but software is not",
    "reviewContent": "I was looking for a phone below 10K. I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. My requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don't strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don't need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data. I don't watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999/- during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749/- . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen? I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you don't need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top. But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I don't have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim + SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few can't especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I don't like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749/- during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, $k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for day-day use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy in-hand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UI(minor) as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G+ always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Don't know may be they will fix it through OTA.*** THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE & THERE, CASUAL GAMER & BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWS/MOVIES... \"NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING\"NOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it's all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it's battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is it's dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by it's amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... don't buy this for camera....just don't. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I don't recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons- cameraüò§üò§,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, camera's good, durability also seems to be good, I've dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it's a little less for me. But I don't have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don't do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it's working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine",

    "review": "Solid phone, worth considering,Good Phone,Overall decent product,Apart from the camera everything is fine,Product is good,Honest Review after 14 days usage,Superb but need improvement in camera,Best camera",
    "reviewContent": "I bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several YouTube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones. My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch. Within 1 month it dropped by 3k.The price qty is ok.Some features are missing which are available in Chinese make model.,Pros1. Display(super amoled)2. Battery life(24 hrs moderate usage)3. Fast charging4. 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1. Miui(lots of unnecessary apps)2.processor(sd 695 is too old)3.main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if you're looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for it.(pubg, cod feels fantastic in this without any lag)If looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brother.,Good phone need improvement in camera,This mobile has the best camera compared with other models",

    "reviewContent": "I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it's build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6.

    "review": "Solid phone, worth considering,Good Phone,Overall decent product,Apart from the camera everything is fine,Product is good,Honest Review after 14 days usage,Superb but need improvement in camera,Best camera",
    "reviewContent": "I bought this phone after tonnes of research and watching and reading several YouTube videos and blog reviews of multiple phones. My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch. Within 1 month it dropped by 3k.The price qty is ok.Some features are missing which are available in Chinese make model.,Pros1. Display(super amoled)2. Battery life(24 hrs moderate usage)3. Fast charging4. 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1. Miui(lots of unnecessary apps)2.processor(sd 695 is too old)3.main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if you're looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for it.(pubg, cod feels fantastic in this without any lag)If looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brother.,Good phone need improvement in camera,This mobile has the best camera compared with other models",
